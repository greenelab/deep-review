# Contribution guidelines for the Deep Review

Please see [`USAGE.md`](USAGE.md) for information on how to use the Manubot for writing the manuscript.
Below you'll find information on the contribution workflow for the Deep Review.

## Issues

We use issues for discussion of papers, section outlines, and other structural components of the paper.

## Pull requests

Contributions to the article operate on a pull request model.
We expect participants to actively review pull requests.
We'd love to have you ask questions, clarify points, and jump in and edit the text.

## Authorship

What qualifies as authorship?
We use the [ICMJE Guidelines](http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html).
We expect authors to contribute to the overall design by participating in issues, to contribute to the text by contributing sections and/or revisions to sections through pull requests.
It is important to note that, for authorship, these should be substantial intellectual contributions.

## Peer review

All pull requests will undergo peer review.
Participants in this project should review proposed changes (pull requests), which can be done using [GitHub's review interface](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-request-reviews/ "GitHub: about pull request reviews").
They should suggest modifications or, potentially, directly edit the pull request to make suggested changes.
As a reviewer, it's helpful to note the type of review you performed:
did you read cited literature, look over the text in detail, or are you just supporting the concept?

Before a repository maintainer merges a pull request, there must be at least one affirmative review.
If there is any unaddressed criticism or disapproval, a repository maintainer will determine how to proceed and may wait for additional feedback.
