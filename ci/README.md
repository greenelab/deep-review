This repository uses [continuous analysis](https://doi.org/10.1101/056473 "Reproducible Computational Workflows with Continuous Analysis") to create the manuscript and commit it back to GitHub.
[`deploy.sh`](deploy.sh) runs on successful `master` branch builds that are not pull requests.
The contents of `/output` are committed to the `gh-pages` branch.
The contents of `/references/generated` are committed to the `references` branch.
