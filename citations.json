To this end, computer vision approaches have been applied to cell segmentation and feature extraction, whereas machine-learning approaches have been developed to aid in phenotypic classification and clustering of data acquired from biological images. Here, we provide an overview of the commonly used computer vision and machine-learning methods for generating and categorizing phenotypic profiles, highlighting the general biological utility of each approach.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Transcriptional enhancers are non-coding segments of DNA that play a central role in the spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression programs. However, systematically and precisely predicting enhancers on a genome-wide scale remain a major challenge. Although existing methods have achieved some success in enhancer prediction, they still suffer from a limited number of training samples, a simplicity of features, class-imbalanced data, and inconsistent performance across diverse cell types/tissues. Here, we developed a deep learning-based algorithmic framework named PEDLA (https://github.com/wenjiegroup/PEDLA), which can directly learn an enhancer predictor from massively heterogeneous data and generalize in ways that are mostly consistent across various cell types/tissues. We first trained PEDLA with 1,114-dimensional heterogeneous features in H1 cells, and we demonstrated that our PEDLA framework integrates diverse heterogeneous features and gives state-of-the-art performance relative to five existing methods for enhancer prediction. We further extended PEDLA to continuously learn from 22 training cell types/tissues, and the results showed that PEDLA manifested superior performance consistency in both training and independent test sets. On average, PEDLA achieved 95.0% accuracy and a 96.8% geometric mean (GM) across 22 training cell types/tissues, as well as 95.7% accuracy and a 96.8% GM across 20 independent test cell types/tissues. Together, our work illustrates the power of harnessing state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to consistently identify regulatory elements at a genome-wide scale from massively heterogeneous data across diverse cell types/tissues.</jats:p>",

EHRs were built for clinical and billing purposes but contain many data points about an individual. Mining these records provides opportunities to extract electronic phenotypes, which can be paired with genetic data to identify genes underlying common human diseases. This task remains challenging: high quality phenotyping is costly and requires physician review; many fields in the records are sparsely filled; and our definitions of diseases are continuing to improve over time. Here we develop and evaluate a semi-supervised learning method for EHR phenotype extraction using denoising autoencoders for phenotype stratification. By combining denoising autoencoders with random forests we find classification improvements across multiple simulation models and improved survival prediction in ALS clinical trial data. This is particularly evident in cases where only a small number of patients have high quality phenotypes, a common scenario in EHR-based research. Denoising autoencoders perform dimensionality reduction enabling visualization and clustering for the discovery of new subtypes of disease. This method represents a promising approach to clarify disease subtypes and improve genotype-phenotype association studies that leverage EHRs.</jats:p>",

Reproducing computational biology experiments, which are scripted, should be straightforward. But reproducing such work remains challenging and time consuming. In the ideal world we would be able to quickly and easily rewind to the precise computing environment where results were generated. We would then be able to reproduce the original analysis or perform new analyses. We introduce a process termed \"continuous analysis\" which provides inherent reproducibility to computational research at a minimal cost to the researcher. Continuous analysis combines Docker, a container service similar to virtual machines, with continuous integration, a popular software development technique, to automatically re-run computational analysis whenever relevant changes are made to the source code. This allows results to be reproduced quickly, accurately and without needing to contact the original authors. Continuous analysis also provides an audit trail for analyses that use data with sharing restrictions. This allows reviewers, editors, and readers to verify reproducibility without manually downloading and rerunning any code. Example configurations are available at our online repository (https://github.com/greenelab/continuous_analysis).</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Motivation: Protein contacts contain key information for the understanding of protein structure and function and thus, contact prediction from sequence is an important problem. Recently exciting progress has been made on this problem, but the predicted contacts for proteins without many sequence homologs is still of low quality and not extremely useful for de novo structure prediction. Method: This paper presents a new deep learning method that predicts contacts by integrating both evolutionary coupling (EC) and sequence conservation information through an ultra-deep neural network formed by two deep residual neural networks. The first residual network conducts a series of 1-dimensional convolutional transformation of sequential features; the second residual network conducts a series of 2-dimensional convolutional transformation of pairwise information including output of the first residual network, EC information and pairwise potential. By using very deep residual networks, we can model very complex relationship between sequence and contact map as well as long-range interdependency between contacts and thus, obtain high-quality contact prediction. Results: Our method greatly outperforms existing contact prediction methods and leads to much more accurate contact-assisted protein folding. Tested on the 105 CASP11 targets, 76 CAMEO test proteins and 398 membrane proteins, the average top L long-range prediction accuracy obtained our method, the representative EC method CCMpred and the CASP11 winner MetaPSICOV is 0.47, 0.21 and 0.30, respectively; the average top L/10 long-range accuracy of our method, CCMpred and MetaPSICOV is 0.77, 0.47 and 0.59, respectively. Ab initio folding using our predicted contacts as restraints can yield correct folds (i.e., TMscore&gt;0.6) for 203 of the 579 test proteins, while that using MetaPSICOV- and CCMpred-predicted contacts can do so for only 79 and 62 of them, respectively. Further, our contact-assisted models also have much better quality than template-based models (especially for membrane proteins). Using our predicted contacts as restraints, we can (ab initio) fold 208 of the 398 membrane proteins with TMscore&gt;0.5. By contrast, when the training proteins of our method are used as templates, homology modeling can only do so for 10 of them. One interesting finding is that even if we train our prediction models with only non-membrane proteins, our method works very well on membrane protein contact prediction. In the recent blind CAMEO benchmark, our method successfully folded one mainly-beta protein of 182 residues, one alpha+beta protein of 125 residues, one mainly-alpha protein of 140 residues, one mainly-alpha protein of 217 residues and one alpha+beta protein of 260 residues, all of which have a novel fold and only 0.3L-2.3L effective sequence homologs.</jats:p>",

We present DeepFlow, a data analysis workflow for imaging flow cytometry that combines deep convolutional neural networks with non-linear dimension reduction. DeepFlow uses learned features of the neural network to visualize, organize and biologically interpret single-cell data. Dissecting the cell cycle as a source of cell-to-cell variability is crucial for quantitative single-cell biology. We demonstrate DeepFlow for a large dataset of cell-cycling Jurkat cells. First, we reconstruct the cells' continuous progression through cell cycle from raw image data. This shows that DeepFlow can learn a continuous distance measure between categorical phenotypes. Second, we are able to detect and separate a subpopulation of dead cells, although the data set had been cleaned using established approaches. DeepFlow detects this morphologically abnormal subpopulation in an unsupervised manner. Third, in label-free classification of cell cycle phases, we reach a 6-fold reduction in error rate as compared to a recent approach based on boosting on a series of image features. In contrast to previous methods, DeepFlow's predictions are fast enough to consider integration with the imaging flow cytometry measurement process.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Objective: The advent of Electronic Medical Records (EMR) with large electronic imaging databases along with advances in deep neural networks with machine learning has provided a unique opportunity to achieve milestones in automated image analysis. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is the most commonly obtained imaging modality in ophthalmology and represents a dense and rich dataset when combined with labels derived from the EMR. We sought to determine if deep learning could be utilized to distinguish normal OCT images from images from patients with Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Design: EMR and OCT database study Subjects: Normal and AMD patients who had a macular OCT. Methods: Automated extraction of an OCT imaging database was performed and linked to clinical endpoints from the EMR. OCT macula scans were obtained by Heidelberg Spectralis, and each OCT scan was linked to EMR clinical endpoints extracted from EPIC. The central 11 images were selected from each OCT scan of two cohorts of patients: normal and AMD. Cross-validation was performed using a random subset of patients. Receiver operator curves (ROC) were constructed at an independent image level, macular OCT level, and patient level. Main outcome measure: Area under the ROC. Results: Of a recent extraction of 2.6 million OCT images linked to clinical datapoints from the EMR, 52,690 normal macular OCT images and 48,312 AMD macular OCT images were selected. A deep neural network was trained to categorize images as either normal or AMD. At the image level, we achieved an area under the ROC of 92.78% with an accuracy of 87.63%. At the macula level, we achieved an area under the ROC of 93.83% with an accuracy of 88.98%. At a patient level, we achieved an area under the ROC of 97.45% with an accuracy of 93.45%. Peak sensitivity and specificity with optimal cutoffs were 92.64% and 93.69% respectively. Conclusions: Deep learning techniques achieve high accuracy and is effective as a new image classification technique. These findings have important implications in utilizing OCT in automated screening and the development of computer aided diagnosis tools in the future.</jats:p>",

Inspired by the success of using deep convolutional features for natural image analysis and conditional random fields (CRF) for structural learning, we propose an end-to-end network for mammographic mass segmentation. The network employs a fully convolutional network (FCN) to model potential function, followed by a CRF to perform structural learning. Because the mass distribution varies greatly with pixel position, the FCN is combined with position priori for the task. Due to the small size of mammogram datasets, we use adversarial training to control over-fitting. Four models with different convolutional kernels are further fused to improve the segmentation results. Experimental results on two public datasets, INbreast and DDSM-BCRP, show that our end-to-end network combined with adversarial training achieves the-state-of-the-art results.</jats:p>",

Current protocols are limited by incomplete CpG coverage and hence methods to predict missing methylation states are critical to enable genome-wide analyses. Here, we report DeepCpG, a computational approach based on deep neural networks to predict DNA methylation states from DNA sequence and incomplete methylation profiles in single cells. We evaluated DeepCpG on single-cell methylation data from five cell types generated using alternative sequencing protocols, finding that DeepCpG yields substantially more accurate predictions than previous methods. Additionally, we show that the parameters of our model can be interpreted, thereby providing insights into the effect of sequence composition on methylation variability.</jats:p>",

Without such a\nlibrary, researchers implementing deep learning workloads on parallel\nprocessors must create and optimize their own implementations of the main\ncomputational kernels, and this work must be repeated as new parallel\nprocessors emerge. To address this problem, we have created a library similar\nin intent to BLAS, with optimized routines for deep learning workloads.

This generative model allows\nefficient search and optimization through open-ended spaces of chemical\ncompounds.

The encoder converts the discrete representation of a molecule into a\nreal-valued continuous vector, and the decoder converts these continuous\nvectors back to the discrete representation from this latent space. Continuous\nrepresentations allow us to automatically generate novel chemical structures by\nperforming simple operations in the latent space, such as decoding random\nvectors, perturbing known chemical structures, or interpolating between\nmolecules. Continuous representations also allow the use of powerful\ngradient-based optimization to efficiently guide the search for optimized\nfunctional compounds.

For example, our quantized version of AlexNet with\n1-bit weights and 2-bit activations achieves $51\\%$ top-1 accuracy. Moreover, we quantize the parameter gradients to 6-bits as well which enables gradients\ncomputation using only bit-wise operation. Quantized recurrent neural networks\nwere tested over the Penn Treebank dataset, and achieved comparable accuracy as\ntheir 32-bit counterparts using only 4-bits. Last but not least, we programmed\na binary matrix multiplication GPU kernel with which it is possible to run our\nMNIST QNN 7 times faster than with an unoptimized GPU kernel, without suffering\nany loss in classification accuracy. The QNN code is available online.},\n archiveprefix = {arXiv},\n author = {Itay Hubara and Matthieu Courbariaux and Daniel Soudry and Ran El-Yaniv and Yoshua Bengio},\n eprint = {1609.07061v1},\n file = {1609.07061v1.pdf},\n link = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07061v1},\n month = {Sep},\n primaryclass = {cs.NE},\n title = {Quantized Neural Networks: Training Neural Networks with Low Precision\nWeights and Activations},\n year = {2016}\n}\n\n",

Instead of engineering algorithms by hand, the ability to learn\ncomposable systems automatically from massive amounts of data has led to\nground-breaking performance in important domains such as computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. The most popular class of\ntechniques used in these domains is called deep learning, and is seeing\nsignificant attention from industry. However, these models require incredible\namounts of data and compute power to train, and are limited by the need for\nbetter hardware acceleration to accommodate scaling beyond current data and\nmodel sizes. While the current solution has been to use clusters of graphics\nprocessing units (GPU) as general purpose processors (GPGPU), the use of field\nprogrammable gate arrays (FPGA) provide an interesting alternative. Current\ntrends in design tools for FPGAs have made them more compatible with the\nhigh-level software practices typically practiced in the deep learning\ncommunity, making FPGAs more accessible to those who build and deploy models.\nSince FPGA architectures are flexible, this could also allow researchers the\nability to explore model-level optimizations beyond what is possible on fixed\narchitectures such as GPUs. As well, FPGAs tend to provide high performance per\nwatt of power consumption, which is of particular importance for application\nscientists interested in large scale server-based deployment or\nresource-limited embedded applications. This review takes a look at deep\nlearning and FPGAs from a hardware acceleration perspective, identifying trends\nand innovations that make these technologies a natural fit, and motivates a\ndiscussion on how FPGAs may best serve the needs of the deep learning community\nmoving forward.},\n archiveprefix = {arXiv},\n author = {Griffin Lacey and Graham W.

Typically, the parameters of the local\nmodels are periodically communicated and averaged to get a global model until\nthe training curve converges (denoted as MA-DNN). However, since DNN is a\nhighly non-convex model, the global model obtained by averaging parameters does\nnot have guarantee on its performance improvement over the local models and\nmight even be worse than the average performance of the local models, which\nleads to the slow-down of convergence and the decrease of the final\nperformance. To tackle this problem, we propose a new parallel training method\ncalled \\emph{Ensemble-Compression} (denoted as EC-DNN). Specifically, we\npropose to aggregate the local models by ensemble, i.e., the outputs of the\nlocal models are averaged instead of the parameters. Considering that the\nwidely used loss functions are convex to the output of the model, the\nperformance of the global model obtained in this way is guaranteed to be at\nleast as good as the average performance of local models. However, the size of\nthe global model will increase after each ensemble and may explode after\nmultiple rounds of ensembles. Thus, we conduct model compression after each\nensemble, to ensure the size of the global model to be the same as the local\nmodels. We conducted experiments on a benchmark dataset. The experimental\nresults demonstrate that our proposed EC-DNN can stably achieve better\nperformance than MA-DNN.},\n archiveprefix = {arXiv},\n author = {Shizhao Sun and Wei Chen and Tie-Yan Liu},\n eprint = {1606.00575v1},\n file = {1606.00575v1.pdf},\n link = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00575v1},\n month = {Jun},\n primaryclass = {cs.DC},\n title = {Ensemble-Compression: A New Method for Parallel Training of Deep Neural\nNetworks},\n year = {2016}\n}\n\n",

Although recurrent networks are extremely powerful\nin what they can in principle represent in terms of modelling sequences,their\ntraining is plagued by two aspects of the same issue regarding the learning of\nlong-term dependencies. Experiments reported here evaluate the use of clipping\ngradients, spanning longer time ranges with leaky integration, advanced\nmomentum techniques, using more powerful output probability models, and\nencouraging sparser gradients to help symmetry breaking and credit assignment.\nThe experiments are performed on text and music data and show off the combined\neffects of these techniques in generally improving both training and test\nerror.},\n archiveprefix = {arXiv},\n author = {Yoshua Bengio and Nicolas Boulanger-Lewandowski and Razvan Pascanu},\n eprint = {1212.0901v2},\n file = {1212.0901v2.pdf},\n link = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.0901v2},\n month = {12},\n primaryclass = {cs.LG},\n title = {Advances in Optimizing Recurrent Networks},\n year = {2012}\n}\n\n",
