To this end, computer vision approaches have been applied to cell segmentation and feature extraction, whereas machine-learning approaches have been developed to aid in phenotypic classification and clustering of data acquired from biological images. Here, we provide an overview of the commonly used computer vision and machine-learning methods for generating and categorizing phenotypic profiles, highlighting the general biological utility of each approach.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Transcriptional enhancers are non-coding segments of DNA that play a central role in the spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression programs. However, systematically and precisely predicting enhancers on a genome-wide scale remain a major challenge. Although existing methods have achieved some success in enhancer prediction, they still suffer from a limited number of training samples, a simplicity of features, class-imbalanced data, and inconsistent performance across diverse cell types/tissues. Here, we developed a deep learning-based algorithmic framework named PEDLA (https://github.com/wenjiegroup/PEDLA), which can directly learn an enhancer predictor from massively heterogeneous data and generalize in ways that are mostly consistent across various cell types/tissues. We first trained PEDLA with 1,114-dimensional heterogeneous features in H1 cells, and we demonstrated that our PEDLA framework integrates diverse heterogeneous features and gives state-of-the-art performance relative to five existing methods for enhancer prediction. We further extended PEDLA to continuously learn from 22 training cell types/tissues, and the results showed that PEDLA manifested superior performance consistency in both training and independent test sets. On average, PEDLA achieved 95.0% accuracy and a 96.8% geometric mean (GM) across 22 training cell types/tissues, as well as 95.7% accuracy and a 96.8% GM across 20 independent test cell types/tissues. Together, our work illustrates the power of harnessing state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to consistently identify regulatory elements at a genome-wide scale from massively heterogeneous data across diverse cell types/tissues.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Patient interactions with health care providers result in entries to electronic health records (EHRs). EHRs were built for clinical and billing purposes but contain many data points about an individual. Mining these records provides opportunities to extract electronic phenotypes, which can be paired with genetic data to identify genes underlying common human diseases. This task remains challenging: high quality phenotyping is costly and requires physician review; many fields in the records are sparsely filled; and our definitions of diseases are continuing to improve over time. Here we develop and evaluate a semi-supervised learning method for EHR phenotype extraction using denoising autoencoders for phenotype stratification. By combining denoising autoencoders with random forests we find classification improvements across multiple simulation models and improved survival prediction in ALS clinical trial data. This is particularly evident in cases where only a small number of patients have high quality phenotypes, a common scenario in EHR-based research. Denoising autoencoders perform dimensionality reduction enabling visualization and clustering for the discovery of new subtypes of disease. This method represents a promising approach to clarify disease subtypes and improve genotype-phenotype association studies that leverage EHRs.</jats:p>",

Reproducing computational biology experiments, which are scripted, should be straightforward. But reproducing such work remains challenging and time consuming. In the ideal world we would be able to quickly and easily rewind to the precise computing environment where results were generated. We would then be able to reproduce the original analysis or perform new analyses. We introduce a process termed \"continuous analysis\" which provides inherent reproducibility to computational research at a minimal cost to the researcher. Continuous analysis combines Docker, a container service similar to virtual machines, with continuous integration, a popular software development technique, to automatically re-run computational analysis whenever relevant changes are made to the source code. This allows results to be reproduced quickly, accurately and without needing to contact the original authors. Continuous analysis also provides an audit trail for analyses that use data with sharing restrictions. This allows reviewers, editors, and readers to verify reproducibility without manually downloading and rerunning any code. Example configurations are available at our online repository (https://github.com/greenelab/continuous_analysis).</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Motivation: Protein contacts contain key information for the understanding of protein structure and function and thus, contact prediction from sequence is an important problem. Recently exciting progress has been made on this problem, but the predicted contacts for proteins without many sequence homologs is still of low quality and not extremely useful for de novo structure prediction. Method: This paper presents a new deep learning method that predicts contacts by integrating both evolutionary coupling (EC) and sequence conservation information through an ultra-deep neural network formed by two deep residual neural networks. The first residual network conducts a series of 1-dimensional convolutional transformation of sequential features; the second residual network conducts a series of 2-dimensional convolutional transformation of pairwise information including output of the first residual network, EC information and pairwise potential. By using very deep residual networks, we can model very complex relationship between sequence and contact map as well as long-range interdependency between contacts and thus, obtain high-quality contact prediction. Results: Our method greatly outperforms existing contact prediction methods and leads to much more accurate contact-assisted protein folding. Tested on the 105 CASP11 targets, 76 CAMEO test proteins and 398 membrane proteins, the average top L long-range prediction accuracy obtained our method, the representative EC method CCMpred and the CASP11 winner MetaPSICOV is 0.47, 0.21 and 0.30, respectively; the average top L/10 long-range accuracy of our method, CCMpred and MetaPSICOV is 0.77, 0.47 and 0.59, respectively. Ab initio folding using our predicted contacts as restraints can yield correct folds (i.e., TMscore&gt;0.6) for 203 of the 579 test proteins, while that using MetaPSICOV- and CCMpred-predicted contacts can do so for only 79 and 62 of them, respectively. Further, our contact-assisted models also have much better quality than template-based models (especially for membrane proteins). Using our predicted contacts as restraints, we can (ab initio) fold 208 of the 398 membrane proteins with TMscore&gt;0.5. By contrast, when the training proteins of our method are used as templates, homology modeling can only do so for 10 of them. One interesting finding is that even if we train our prediction models with only non-membrane proteins, our method works very well on membrane protein contact prediction. In the recent blind CAMEO benchmark, our method successfully folded one mainly-beta protein of 182 residues, one alpha+beta protein of 125 residues, one mainly-alpha protein of 140 residues, one mainly-alpha protein of 217 residues and one alpha+beta protein of 260 residues, all of which have a novel fold and only 0.3L-2.3L effective sequence homologs.</jats:p>",

We present DeepFlow, a data analysis workflow for imaging flow cytometry that combines deep convolutional neural networks with non-linear dimension reduction. DeepFlow uses learned features of the neural network to visualize, organize and biologically interpret single-cell data. Dissecting the cell cycle as a source of cell-to-cell variability is crucial for quantitative single-cell biology. We demonstrate DeepFlow for a large dataset of cell-cycling Jurkat cells. First, we reconstruct the cells' continuous progression through cell cycle from raw image data. This shows that DeepFlow can learn a continuous distance measure between categorical phenotypes. Second, we are able to detect and separate a subpopulation of dead cells, although the data set had been cleaned using established approaches. DeepFlow detects this morphologically abnormal subpopulation in an unsupervised manner. Third, in label-free classification of cell cycle phases, we reach a 6-fold reduction in error rate as compared to a recent approach based on boosting on a series of image features. In contrast to previous methods, DeepFlow's predictions are fast enough to consider integration with the imaging flow cytometry measurement process.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Objective: The advent of Electronic Medical Records (EMR) with large electronic imaging databases along with advances in deep neural networks with machine learning has provided a unique opportunity to achieve milestones in automated image analysis. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is the most commonly obtained imaging modality in ophthalmology and represents a dense and rich dataset when combined with labels derived from the EMR. We sought to determine if deep learning could be utilized to distinguish normal OCT images from images from patients with Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Design: EMR and OCT database study Subjects: Normal and AMD patients who had a macular OCT. Methods: Automated extraction of an OCT imaging database was performed and linked to clinical endpoints from the EMR. OCT macula scans were obtained by Heidelberg Spectralis, and each OCT scan was linked to EMR clinical endpoints extracted from EPIC. The central 11 images were selected from each OCT scan of two cohorts of patients: normal and AMD. Cross-validation was performed using a random subset of patients. Receiver operator curves (ROC) were constructed at an independent image level, macular OCT level, and patient level. Main outcome measure: Area under the ROC. Results: Of a recent extraction of 2.6 million OCT images linked to clinical datapoints from the EMR, 52,690 normal macular OCT images and 48,312 AMD macular OCT images were selected. A deep neural network was trained to categorize images as either normal or AMD. At the image level, we achieved an area under the ROC of 92.78% with an accuracy of 87.63%. At the macula level, we achieved an area under the ROC of 93.83% with an accuracy of 88.98%. At a patient level, we achieved an area under the ROC of 97.45% with an accuracy of 93.45%. Peak sensitivity and specificity with optimal cutoffs were 92.64% and 93.69% respectively. Conclusions: Deep learning techniques achieve high accuracy and is effective as a new image classification technique. These findings have important implications in utilizing OCT in automated screening and the development of computer aided diagnosis tools in the future.</jats:p>",

Inspired by the success of using deep convolutional features for natural image analysis and conditional random fields (CRF) for structural learning, we propose an end-to-end network for mammographic mass segmentation. The network employs a fully convolutional network (FCN) to model potential function, followed by a CRF to perform structural learning. Because the mass distribution varies greatly with pixel position, the FCN is combined with position priori for the task. Due to the small size of mammogram datasets, we use adversarial training to control over-fitting. Four models with different convolutional kernels are further fused to improve the segmentation results. Experimental results on two public datasets, INbreast and DDSM-BCRP, show that our end-to-end network combined with adversarial training achieves the-state-of-the-art results.</jats:p>",

Traditional methods requires great effort to annotate the training data by costly manual labeling and specialized computational models to detect these annotations during test. Inspired by the success of using deep convolutional features for natural image analysis and multi-instance learning for labeling a set of instances/patches, we propose end-to-end trained deep multi-instance networks for mass classification based on whole mammogram without the aforementioned costly need to annotate the training data. We explore three different schemes to construct deep multi-instance networks for whole mammogram classification.

Deep learning workloads are computationally intensive, and\noptimizing their kernels is difficult and time-consuming. As parallel\narchitectures evolve, kernels must be reoptimized, which makes maintaining\ncodebases difficult over time. Similar issues have long been addressed in the\nHPC community by libraries such as the Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines (BLAS).\nHowever, there is no analogous library for deep learning. Without such a\nlibrary, researchers implementing deep learning workloads on parallel\nprocessors must create and optimize their own implementations of the main\ncomputational kernels, and this work must be repeated as new parallel\nprocessors emerge. To address this problem, we have created a library similar\nin intent to BLAS, with optimized routines for deep learning workloads. Our\nimplementation contains routines for GPUs, although similarly to the BLAS\nlibrary, these routines could be implemented for other platforms. The library\nis easy to integrate into existing frameworks, and provides optimized\nperformance and memory usage. For example, integrating cuDNN into Caffe, a\npopular framework for convolutional networks, improves performance by 36% on a\nstandard model while also reducing memory consumption.},\n archiveprefix = {arXiv},\n author = {Sharan Chetlur and Cliff Woolley and Philippe Vandermersch and Jonathan Cohen and John Tran and Bryan Catanzaro and Evan Shelhamer},\n eprint = {1410.0759v3},\n file = {1410.0759v3.pdf},\n link = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0759v3},\n month = {Nov},\n primaryclass = {cs.NE},\n title = {cuDNN: Efficient Primitives for Deep Learning},\n year = {2014}\n}\n\n",

This generative model allows\nefficient search and optimization through open-ended spaces of chemical\ncompounds. We train deep neural networks on hundreds of thousands of existing\nchemical structures to construct two coupled functions: an encoder and a\ndecoder. The encoder converts the discrete representation of a molecule into a\nreal-valued continuous vector, and the decoder converts these continuous\nvectors back to the discrete representation from this latent space. Continuous\nrepresentations allow us to automatically generate novel chemical structures by\nperforming simple operations in the latent space, such as decoding random\nvectors, perturbing known chemical structures, or interpolating between\nmolecules. Continuous representations also allow the use of powerful\ngradient-based optimization to efficiently guide the search for optimized\nfunctional compounds.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Genes play a central role in all biological processes. DNA microarray technology has made it possible to study the expression behavior of thousands of genes in one go. Often, gene expression data is used to generate features for supervised and unsupervised learning tasks. At the same time, advances in the field of deep learning have made available a plethora of architectures. In this paper, we use deep architectures pre-trained in an unsupervised manner using denoising autoencoders as a preprocessing step for a popular unsupervised learning task. Denoising autoencoders (DA) can be used to learn a compact representation of input, and have been used to generate features for further supervised learning tasks. We propose that our deep architectures can be treated as empirical versions of Deep Belief Networks (DBNs). We use our deep architectures to regenerate gene expression time series data for two different data sets. We test our hypothesis on two popular datasets for the unsupervised learning task of clustering and find promising improvements in performance.</jats:p>",

At train-time the quantized weights and activations are used for\ncomputing the parameter gradients. During the forward pass, QNNs drastically\nreduce memory size and accesses, and replace most arithmetic operations with\nbit-wise operations. As a result, power consumption is expected to be\ndrastically reduced. We trained QNNs over the MNIST, CIFAR-10, SVHN and\nImageNet datasets. The resulting QNNs achieve prediction accuracy comparable to\ntheir 32-bit counterparts. For example, our quantized version of AlexNet with\n1-bit weights and 2-bit activations achieves $51\\%$ top-1 accuracy. Moreover, we quantize the parameter gradients to 6-bits as well which enables gradients\ncomputation using only bit-wise operation. Quantized recurrent neural networks\nwere tested over the Penn Treebank dataset, and achieved comparable accuracy as\ntheir 32-bit counterparts using only 4-bits. Last but not least, we programmed\na binary matrix multiplication GPU kernel with which it is possible to run our\nMNIST QNN 7 times faster than with an unoptimized GPU kernel, without suffering\nany loss in classification accuracy. The QNN code is available online.},\n archiveprefix = {arXiv},\n author = {Itay Hubara and Matthieu Courbariaux and Daniel Soudry and Ran El-Yaniv and Yoshua Bengio},\n eprint = {1609.07061v1},\n file = {1609.07061v1.pdf},\n link = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07061v1},\n month = {Sep},\n primaryclass = {cs.NE},\n title = {Quantized Neural Networks: Training Neural Networks with Low Precision\nWeights and Activations},\n year = {2016}\n}\n\n",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Advancements in sequencing technologies have highlighted the role of alternative splicing (AS) in increasing transcriptome complexity. This role of AS, combined with the relation of aberrant splicing to malignant states, motivated two streams of research, experimental and computational. The first involves a myriad of techniques such as RNA-Seq and CLIP-Seq to identify splicing regulators and their putative targets. The second involves probabilistic models, also known as splicing codes, which infer regulatory mechanisms and predict splicing outcome directly from genomic sequence. To date, these models have utilized only expression data. In this work we address two related challenges: Can we improve on previous models for AS outcome prediction and can we integrate additional sources of data to improve predictions for AS regulatory factors. We perform a detailed comparison of two previous modeling approaches, Bayesian and Deep Neural networks, dissecting the confounding effects of datasets and target functions. We then develop a new target function for AS prediction and show that it significantly improves model accuracy. Next, we develop a modeling framework to incorporate CLIP-Seq, knockdown and over-expression experiments, which are inherently noisy and suffer from missing values. Using several datasets involving key splice factors in mouse brain, muscle and heart we demonstrate both the prediction improvements and biological insights offered by our new models. Overall, the framework we propose offers a scalable integrative solution to improve splicing code modeling as vast amounts of relevant genomic data become available.\n\nAvailability: code and data will be available on Github following publication.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>We compare and contrast genome-wide compositional biases and distributions of short oligonucleotides across 15 diverse prokaryotes that have substantial genomic sequence collections. These include seven complete genomes (Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803, Methanococcus jannaschii, and Pyrobaculum aerophilum). A key observation concerns the constancy of the dinucleotide relative abundance profiles over multiple 50-kb disjoint contigs within the same genome. (The profile is rhoXY* = fXY*/fX*fY* for all XY, where fX* denotes the frequency of the nucleotide X and fY* denotes the frequency of the dinucleotide XY, both computed from the sequence concatenated with its inverted complementary sequence.) On the basis of this constancy, we refer to the collection [rhoXY*] as the genome signature. We establish that the differences between [rhoXY*] vectors of 50-kb sample contigs of different genomes virtually always exceed the differences between those of the same genomes. Various di- and tetranucleotide biases are identified. In particular, we find that the dinucleotide CpG=CG is underrepresented in many thermophiles (e.g., M. jannaschii, Sulfolobus sp., and M. thermoautotrophicum) but overrepresented in halobacteria. TA is broadly underrepresented in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, but normal counts appear in Sulfolobus and P. aerophilum sequences. More than for any other bacterial genome, palindromic tetranucleotides are underrepresented in H. influenzae. The M. jannaschii sequence is unprecedented in its extreme underrepresentation of CTAG tetranucleotides and in the anomalous distribution of CTAG sites around the genome. Comparative analysis of numbers of long tetranucleotide microsatellites distinguishes H. influenzae. Dinucleotide relative abundance differences between bacterial sequences are compared. For example, in these assessments of differences, the cyanobacteria Synechocystis, Synechococcus, and Anabaena do not form a coherent group and are as far from each other as general gram-negative sequences are from general gram-positive sequences. The difference of M. jannaschii from low-G+C gram-positive proteobacteria is one-half of the difference from gram-negative proteobacteria. Interpretations and hypotheses center on the role of the genome signature in highlighting similarities and dissimilarities across different classes of prokaryotic species, possible mechanisms underlying the genome signature, the form and level of genome compositional flux, the use of the genome signature as a chronometer of molecular phylogeny, and implications with respect to the three putative eubacterial, archaeal, and eukaryote domains of life and to the origin and early evolution of eukaryotes.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Motivation: Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments are commonly used to obtain genome-wide profiles of histone modifications associated with different types of functional genomic elements. However, the quality of histone ChIP-seq data is affected by a myriad of experimental parameters such as the amount of input DNA, antibody specificity, ChIP enrichment, and sequencing depth. Making accurate inferences from chromatin profiling experiments that involve diverse experimental parameters is challenging.  Results: We introduce a convolutional denoising algorithm, Coda, that uses convolutional neural networks to learn a mapping from suboptimal to high-quality histone ChIP-seq data. This overcomes various sources of noise and variability, substantially enhancing and recovering signal when applied to low-quality chromatin profiling datasets across individuals, cell types, and species. Our method has the potential to improve data quality at reduced costs. More broadly, this approach -- using a high-dimensional discriminative model to encode a generative noise process -- is generally applicable to other biological domains where it is easy to generate noisy data but difficult to analytically characterize the noise or underlying data distribution.

Instead of engineering algorithms by hand, the ability to learn\ncomposable systems automatically from massive amounts of data has led to\nground-breaking performance in important domains such as computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. The most popular class of\ntechniques used in these domains is called deep learning, and is seeing\nsignificant attention from industry. However, these models require incredible\namounts of data and compute power to train, and are limited by the need for\nbetter hardware acceleration to accommodate scaling beyond current data and\nmodel sizes. While the current solution has been to use clusters of graphics\nprocessing units (GPU) as general purpose processors (GPGPU), the use of field\nprogrammable gate arrays (FPGA) provide an interesting alternative. Current\ntrends in design tools for FPGAs have made them more compatible with the\nhigh-level software practices typically practiced in the deep learning\ncommunity, making FPGAs more accessible to those who build and deploy models.\nSince FPGA architectures are flexible, this could also allow researchers the\nability to explore model-level optimizations beyond what is possible on fixed\narchitectures such as GPUs. As well, FPGAs tend to provide high performance per\nwatt of power consumption, which is of particular importance for application\nscientists interested in large scale server-based deployment or\nresource-limited embedded applications. This review takes a look at deep\nlearning and FPGAs from a hardware acceleration perspective, identifying trends\nand innovations that make these technologies a natural fit, and motivates a\ndiscussion on how FPGAs may best serve the needs of the deep learning community\nmoving forward.},\n archiveprefix = {arXiv},\n author = {Griffin Lacey and Graham W.

However, it remains unclear how these approaches identify\nmeaningful DNA sequence signals and give insights as to why TFs bind to certain\nlocations. In this paper, we propose a toolkit called the Deep Motif Dashboard\n(DeMo Dashboard) which provides a suite of visualization strategies to extract\nmotifs, or sequence patterns from deep neural network models for TFBS\nclassification. We demonstrate how to visualize and understand three important\nDNN models: convolutional, recurrent, and convolutional-recurrent networks. Our\nfirst visualization method is finding a test sequence's saliency map which uses\nfirst-order derivatives to describe the importance of each nucleotide in making\nthe final prediction. Second, considering recurrent models make predictions in\na temporal manner (from one end of a TFBS sequence to the other), we introduce\ntemporal output scores, indicating the prediction score of a model over time\nfor a sequential input. Lastly, a class-specific visualization strategy finds\nthe optimal input sequence for a given TFBS positive class via stochastic\ngradient optimization. Our experimental results indicate that a\nconvolutional-recurrent architecture performs the best among the three\narchitectures. The visualization techniques indicate that CNN-RNN makes\npredictions by modeling both motifs as well as dependencies among them.},\n archiveprefix = {arXiv},\n author = {Jack Lanchantin and Ritambhara Singh and Beilun Wang and Yanjun Qi},\n eprint = {1608.03644v4},\n file = {1608.03644v4.pdf},\n link = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03644v4},\n month = {Aug},\n primaryclass = {cs.LG},\n title = {Deep Motif Dashboard: Visualizing and Understanding Genomic Sequences\nUsing Deep Neural Networks},\n year = {2016}\n}\n\n",

For this reason, leveraging\nthe resources of a cluster to speed up training is an important area of work.\nHowever, widely-popular batch-processing computational frameworks like\nMapReduce and Spark were not designed to support the asynchronous and\ncommunication-intensive workloads of existing distributed deep learning\nsystems. We introduce SparkNet, a framework for training deep networks in\nSpark. Our implementation includes a convenient interface for reading data from\nSpark RDDs, a Scala interface to the Caffe deep learning framework, and a\nlightweight multi-dimensional tensor library. Using a simple parallelization\nscheme for stochastic gradient descent, SparkNet scales well with the cluster\nsize and tolerates very high-latency communication. Furthermore, it is easy to\ndeploy and use with no parameter tuning, and it is compatible with existing\nCaffe models. We quantify the dependence of the speedup obtained by SparkNet on\nthe number of machines, the communication frequency, and the cluster's\ncommunication overhead, and we benchmark our system's performance on the\nImageNet dataset.},\n archiveprefix = {arXiv},\n author = {Philipp Moritz and Robert Nishihara and Ion Stoica and Michael I.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Organizing single cells along a developmental trajectory has emerged as a powerful tool for understanding how gene regulation governs cell fate decisions. However, learning the structure of complex single-cell trajectories with two or more branches remains a challenging computational problem. We present Monocle 2, which uses reversed graph embedding to reconstruct single-cell trajectories in a fully unsupervised manner. Monocle 2 learns an explicit principal graph to describe the data, greatly improving the robustness and accuracy of its trajectories compared to other algorithms. Monocle 2 uncovered a new, alternative cell fate in what we previously reported to be a linear trajectory for differentiating myoblasts. We also reconstruct branched trajectories for two studies of blood development, and show that loss of function mutations in key lineage transcription factors diverts cells to alternative branches on the a trajectory. Monocle 2 is thus a powerful tool for analyzing cell fate decisions with single-cell genomics.</jats:p>",

Researchers and industry have developed several\ntechniques to optimize SGD's runtime performance, including asynchronous\nexecution and reduced precision. Our main result is a martingale-based analysis\nthat enables us to capture the rich noise models that may arise from such\ntechniques. Specifically, we use our new analysis in three ways: (1) we derive\nconvergence rates for the convex case (Hogwild!) with relaxed assumptions on\nthe sparsity of the problem; (2) we analyze asynchronous SGD algorithms for\nnon-convex matrix problems including matrix completion; and (3) we design and\nanalyze an asynchronous SGD algorithm, called Buckwild!, that uses\nlower-precision arithmetic. We show experimentally that our algorithms run\nefficiently for a variety of problems on modern hardware.},\n archiveprefix = {arXiv},\n author = {Christopher De Sa and Ce Zhang and Kunle Olukotun and Christopher Ré},\n eprint = {1506.06438v2},\n file = {1506.06438v2.pdf},\n link = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06438v2},\n month = {Jun},\n primaryclass = {cs.LG},\n title = {Taming the Wild: A Unified Analysis of Hogwild!-Style Algorithms},\n year = {2015}\n}\n\n",

Computational methods that predict gene expression\nfrom histone modification signals are highly desirable for understanding their\ncombinatorial effects in gene regulation. This knowledge can help in developing\n'epigenetic drugs' for diseases like cancer. Previous studies for quantifying\nthe relationship between histone modifications and gene expression levels\neither failed to capture combinatorial effects or relied on multiple methods\nthat separate predictions and combinatorial analysis. This paper develops a\nunified discriminative framework using a deep convolutional neural network to\nclassify gene expression using histone modification data as input. Our system, called DeepChrome, allows automatic extraction of complex interactions among\nimportant features. To simultaneously visualize the combinatorial interactions\namong histone modifications, we propose a novel optimization-based technique\nthat generates feature pattern maps from the learnt deep model. This provides\nan intuitive description of underlying epigenetic mechanisms that regulate\ngenes. Results: We show that DeepChrome outperforms state-of-the-art models\nlike Support Vector Machines and Random Forests for gene expression\nclassification task on 56 different cell-types from REMC database.

This review focuses on five important metagenomic problems:OTU-clustering, binning, taxonomic proffiing and assignment, comparative metagenomics and gene prediction. For each of these problems, we identify the most prominent methods, summarize the machine learning approaches used and put them into perspective of similar methods.We conclude our review looking further ahead at the challenge posed by the analysis of interactions within microbial communities and different environments, in a field one could call “integrative metagenomics”.</jats:p>",

To tackle this problem, we propose a new parallel training method\ncalled \\emph{Ensemble-Compression} (denoted as EC-DNN). Specifically, we\npropose to aggregate the local models by ensemble, i.e., the outputs of the\nlocal models are averaged instead of the parameters. Considering that the\nwidely used loss functions are convex to the output of the model, the\nperformance of the global model obtained in this way is guaranteed to be at\nleast as good as the average performance of local models. However, the size of\nthe global model will increase after each ensemble and may explode after\nmultiple rounds of ensembles. Thus, we conduct model compression after each\nensemble, to ensure the size of the global model to be the same as the local\nmodels. We conducted experiments on a benchmark dataset. The experimental\nresults demonstrate that our proposed EC-DNN can stably achieve better\nperformance than MA-DNN.},\n archiveprefix = {arXiv},\n author = {Shizhao Sun and Wei Chen and Tie-Yan Liu},\n eprint = {1606.00575v1},\n file = {1606.00575v1.pdf},\n link = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00575v1},\n month = {Jun},\n primaryclass = {cs.DC},\n title = {Ensemble-Compression: A New Method for Parallel Training of Deep Neural\nNetworks},\n year = {2016}\n}\n\n",

Although DNNs work well whenever large\nlabeled training sets are available, they cannot be used to map sequences to\nsequences. In this paper, we present a general end-to-end approach to sequence\nlearning that makes minimal assumptions on the sequence structure. Our method\nuses a multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to map the input sequence to\na vector of a fixed dimensionality, and then another deep LSTM to decode the\ntarget sequence from the vector. Our main result is that on an English to\nFrench translation task from the WMT'14 dataset, the translations produced by\nthe LSTM achieve a BLEU score of 34.8 on the entire test set, where the LSTM's\nBLEU score was penalized on out-of-vocabulary words. Additionally, the LSTM did\nnot have difficulty on long sentences. For comparison, a phrase-based SMT\nsystem achieves a BLEU score of 33.3 on the same dataset. When we used the LSTM\nto rerank the 1000 hypotheses produced by the aforementioned SMT system, its\nBLEU score increases to 36.5, which is close to the previous best result on\nthis task. The LSTM also learned sensible phrase and sentence representations\nthat are sensitive to word order and are relatively invariant to the active and\nthe passive voice. Finally, we found that reversing the order of the words in\nall source sentences (but not target sentences) improved the LSTM's performance\nmarkedly, because doing so introduced many short term dependencies between the\nsource and the target sentence which made the optimization problem easier.},\n archiveprefix = {arXiv},\n author = {Ilya Sutskever and Oriol Vinyals and Quoc V.

In this approach, the machine-learned ADAGE model contained 50 nodes which we predicted would correspond to gene expression patterns across the gene expression compendium. While no biological knowledge was used during model construction, cooperonic genes had similar weights across nodes, and genes with similar weights across nodes were significantly more likely to share KEGG pathways. By analyzing newly generated and previously published microarray and transcriptome sequencing data, the ADAGE model identified differences between strains, modeled the cellular response to low oxygen, and predicted the involvement of biological processes based on low-level gene expression differences. ADAGE compared favorably with traditional principal component analysis and independent component analysis approaches in its ability to extract validated patterns, and based on our analyses, we propose that these approaches differ in the types of patterns they preferentially identify.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Cross experiment comparisons in public data compendia are challenged by unmatched conditions and technical noise. The ADAGE method, which performs unsupervised integration with neural networks, can effectively identify biological patterns, but because ADAGE models, like many neural networks, are over-parameterized, different ADAGE models perform equally well. To enhance model robustness and better build signatures consistent with biological pathways, we developed an ensemble ADAGE (eADAGE) that integrated stable signatures across models. We applied eADAGE to a Pseudomonas aeruginosa compendium containing experiments performed in 78 media. eADAGE revealed a phosphate starvation response controlled by PhoB. While we expected PhoB activity in limiting phosphate conditions, our analyses found PhoB activity in other media with moderate phosphate and predicted that a second stimulus provided by the sensor kinase, KinB, is required for PhoB activation in this setting. We validated this relationship using both targeted and unbiased genetic approaches. eADAGE, which captures stable biological patterns, enables cross-experiment comparisons that can highlight measured but undiscovered relationships.</jats:p>",

The quality of these\nrepresentations is measured in a word similarity task, and the results are\ncompared to the previously best performing techniques based on different types\nof neural networks. We observe large improvements in accuracy at much lower\ncomputational cost, i.e. it takes less than a day to learn high quality word\nvectors from a 1.6 billion words data set. Furthermore, we show that these\nvectors provide state-of-the-art performance on our test set for measuring\nsyntactic and semantic word similarities.},\n archiveprefix = {arXiv},\n author = {Tomas Mikolov and Kai Chen and Greg Corrado and Jeffrey Dean},\n eprint = {1301.3781v3},\n file = {1301.3781v3.pdf},\n link = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781v3},\n month = {Jan},\n primaryclass = {cs.CL},\n title = {Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space},\n year = {2013}\n}\n\n",

Given that DNNs are now able to classify objects in\nimages with near-human-level performance, questions naturally arise as to what\ndifferences remain between computer and human vision. A recent study revealed\nthat changing an image (e.g. of a lion) in a way imperceptible to humans can\ncause a DNN to label the image as something else entirely (e.g. mislabeling a\nlion a library). Here we show a related result: it is easy to produce images\nthat are completely unrecognizable to humans, but that state-of-the-art DNNs\nbelieve to be recognizable objects with 99.99% confidence (e.g. labeling with\ncertainty that white noise static is a lion). Specifically, we take\nconvolutional neural networks trained to perform well on either the ImageNet or\nMNIST datasets and then find images with evolutionary algorithms or gradient\nascent that DNNs label with high confidence as belonging to each dataset class.\nIt is possible to produce images totally unrecognizable to human eyes that DNNs\nbelieve with near certainty are familiar objects, which we call \"fooling\nimages\" (more generally, fooling examples). Our results shed light on\ninteresting differences between human vision and current DNNs, and raise\nquestions about the generality of DNN computer vision.},\n archiveprefix = {arXiv},\n author = {Anh Nguyen and Jason Yosinski and Jeff Clune},\n eprint = {1412.1897v4},\n file = {1412.1897v4.pdf},\n link = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.1897v4},\n month = {12},\n primaryclass = {cs.CV},\n title = {Deep Neural Networks are Easily Fooled: High Confidence Predictions for\nUnrecognizable Images},\n year = {2014}\n}\n\n",

In this\nwork, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the\npredictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by\nlearning an interpretable model locally around the prediction.

We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by\nexplaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image\nclassification (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via\nnovel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios\nthat require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between\nmodels, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier\nshould not be trusted.},\n archiveprefix = {arXiv},\n author = {Marco Tulio Ribeiro and Sameer Singh and Carlos Guestrin},\n eprint = {1602.04938v3},\n file = {1602.04938v3.pdf},\n link = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938v3},\n month = {Feb},\n primaryclass = {cs.LG},\n title = {\"Why Should I Trust You?\": Explaining the Predictions of Any Classifier},\n year = {2016}\n}\n\n",

In\ntime series prediction and other related tasks, it has been noted that missing\nvalues and their missing patterns are often correlated with the target labels, a.k.a., informative missingness. There is very limited work on exploiting the\nmissing patterns for effective imputation and improving prediction performance.\nIn this paper, we develop novel deep learning models, namely GRU-D, as one of\nthe early attempts. GRU-D is based on Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), a\nstate-of-the-art recurrent neural network. It takes two representations of\nmissing patterns, i.e., masking and time interval, and effectively incorporates\nthem into a deep model architecture so that it not only captures the long-term\ntemporal dependencies in time series, but also utilizes the missing patterns to\nachieve better prediction results. Experiments of time series classification\ntasks on real-world clinical datasets (MIMIC-III, PhysioNet) and synthetic\ndatasets demonstrate that our models achieve state-of-the-art performance and\nprovides useful insights for better understanding and utilization of missing\nvalues in time series analysis.},\n archiveprefix = {arXiv},\n author = {Zhengping Che and Sanjay Purushotham and Kyunghyun Cho and David Sontag and Yan Liu},\n eprint = {1606.01865v2},\n file = {1606.01865v2.pdf},\n link = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01865v2},\n month = {Jun},\n primaryclass = {cs.LG},\n title = {Recurrent Neural Networks for Multivariate Time Series with Missing\nValues},\n year = {2016}\n}\n\n",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Despite many recent advances in systems biology and a marked increase in the availability of high-throughput biological data, the productivity of research and development in the pharmaceutical industry is on the decline. This is primarily due to clinical trial failure rates reaching up to 95% in oncology and other disease areas. We have developed a comprehensive analytical and computational pipeline utilizing deep learning techniques and novel systems biology analytical tools to predict the outcomes of phase I/II clinical trials. The pipeline predicts the side effects of a drug using deep neural networks and estimates drug-induced pathway activation. It then uses the predicted side effect probabilities and pathway activation scores as an input to train a classifier which predicts clinical trial outcomes. This classifier was trained on 577 transcriptomic datasets and has achieved a cross-validated accuracy of 0.83. When compared to a direct gene-based classifier, our multi-stage approach dramatically improves the accuracy of the predictions. The classifier was applied to a set of compounds currently present in the pipelines of several major pharmaceutical companies to highlight potential risks in their portfolios and estimate the fraction of clinical trials that were likely to fail in phase I and II.</jats:p>",

These models\nrequire expert-level knowledge of physical chemistry and biology to be encoded\nas hand-tuned parameters or features rather than allowing the underlying model\nto select features in a data-driven procedure. Here, we develop a general\n3-dimensional spatial convolution operation for learning atomic-level chemical\ninteractions directly from atomic coordinates and demonstrate its application\nto structure-based bioactivity prediction. The atomic convolutional neural\nnetwork is trained to predict the experimentally determined binding affinity of\na protein-ligand complex by direct calculation of the energy associated with\nthe complex, protein, and ligand given the crystal structure of the binding\npose. Non-covalent interactions present in the complex that are absent in the\nprotein-ligand sub-structures are identified and the model learns the\ninteraction strength associated with these features. We test our model by\npredicting the binding free energy of a subset of protein-ligand complexes\nfound in the PDBBind dataset and compare with state-of-the-art cheminformatics\nand machine learning-based approaches. We find that all methods achieve\nexperimental accuracy and that atomic convolutional networks either outperform\nor perform competitively with the cheminformatics based methods. Unlike all\nprevious protein-ligand prediction systems, atomic convolutional networks are\nend-to-end and fully-differentiable. They represent a new data-driven, physics-based deep learning model paradigm that offers a strong foundation for\nfuture improvements in structure-based bioactivity prediction.},\n archiveprefix = {arXiv},\n author = {Joseph Gomes and Bharath Ramsundar and Evan N.

However, a variety of new neural net\ntechniques along with successful applications in other domains have renewed\ninterest in network approaches. In this work, inspired by the winning team's\nuse of neural networks in a recent QSAR competition, we used an artificial\nneural network to learn a function that predicts activities of compounds for\nmultiple assays at the same time. We conducted experiments leveraging recent\nmethods for dealing with overfitting in neural networks as well as other tricks\nfrom the neural networks literature. We compared our methods to alternative\nmethods reported to perform well on these tasks and found that our neural net\nmethods provided superior performance.},\n archiveprefix = {arXiv},\n author = {George E.

However, algorithmic progress has been limited due to the lack of a\nstandard benchmark to compare the efficacy of proposed methods; most new\nalgorithms are benchmarked on different datasets making it challenging to gauge\nthe quality of proposed methods. This work introduces MoleculeNet, a large\nscale benchmark for molecular machine learning. MoleculeNet curates multiple\npublic datasets, establishes metrics for evaluation, and offers high quality\nopen-source implementations of multiple previously proposed molecular\nfeaturization and learning algorithms (released as part of the DeepChem open\nsource library). MoleculeNet benchmarks demonstrate that learnable\nrepresentations, and in particular graph convolutional networks, are powerful\ntools for molecular machine learning and broadly offer the best performance.\nHowever, for quantum mechanical and biophysical datasets, the use of\nphysics-aware featurizations can be significantly more important than choice of\nparticular learning algorithm.},\n archiveprefix = {arXiv},\n author = {Zhenqin Wu and Bharath Ramsundar and Evan N.
