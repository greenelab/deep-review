## Methods

### Continuous collaborative manuscript drafting

We recognized that deep learning in precision medicine is a rapidly developing area.
Hence, diverse expertise was required to provide a forward-looking perspective.
Accordingly, we collaboratively wrote this review in the open, enabling anyone with expertise to contribute.
We wrote the manuscript in markdown and tracked changes using git.
Contributions were handled through GitHub, with individuals submitting "pull requests" to suggest additions to the manuscript.
This collaborative writing approach was later generalized into [Manubot](https://manubot.org/) [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007128].

Manubot supports citations of persistent identifiers, such as DOIs, PubMed Central IDs, PubMed IDs, arXiv IDs, and URLs.
This reduces one major barrier to writing collaboratively, which is syncing reference managers between participants.
In addition, Manubot uses continuous integration to build and deploy manuscripts.
This allows for automated error checking of proposed changes to catch malformated citations and invalid syntax.
Originally, the Deep Review used Travis CI for continuous integration, but in 2020 switched to GitHub Actions, which became the default for Manubot manuscripts.

For version 1.0 of the Deep Review, author order was randomized as described in [version 1.0] [@tag:techblog-perkel].
However, this was a one-time manual process.
Starting with version 2.0, we began shuffling authors for every manuscript version.
Manubot allowed us to automate this process, using the Git commit hash as a random seed to ensure reproducible ordering.

### Author contributions

#### Version 2.0

We continued using the open repository on the GitHub version control platform ([`greenelab/deep-review`](https://github.com/greenelab/deep-review)) [@url:https://github.com/greenelab/deep-review], which was established to write the version 1.0 manuscript.
{% for v2, authors in manubot.authors|groupby('v2') %}
  {% if v2|length %}{{ v2 }}: {% for author in authors %}{{author.name }}{% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}{% endfor %}. {% endif %}
{% endfor %}

#### Version 1.0

We created an open repository on the GitHub version control platform ([`greenelab/deep-review`](https://github.com/greenelab/deep-review)) [@url:https://github.com/greenelab/deep-review].
Here, we engaged with numerous authors from papers within and outside of the area.
The manuscript was drafted via GitHub commits by individuals who met the ICMJE standards of authorship.
These were individuals who contributed to the review of the literature;
drafted the manuscript or provided substantial critical revisions;
approved the final manuscript draft; and agreed to be accountable in all aspects of the work.
Individuals who did not contribute in all of these ways, but who did participate, are acknowledged below.
We grouped authors into the following four classes of approximately equal contributions and randomly ordered authors within each contribution class.
Drafted multiple sub-sections along with extensive editing, pull request reviews, or discussion: Travers Ching, Brett K. Beaulieu-Jones, Alexandr A. Kalinin, Brian T. Do, Gregory P. Way, Enrico Ferrero, Paul-Michael Agapow, Michael Zietz, Michael M. Hoffman.
Edited the manuscript, reviewed pull requests, and developed Manubot: Daniel S. Himmelstein.
Drafted one or more sub-sections: Wei Xie, Gail L. Rosen, Benjamin J. Lengerich, Johnny Israeli, Jack Lanchantin, Stephen Woloszynek, Anne E. Carpenter, Avanti Shrikumar, Jinbo Xu, Evan M. Cofer, Christopher A. Lavender, Srinivas C. Turaga, Amr M. Alexandari, Zhiyong Lu.
Drafted sub-sections, edited the manuscript, reviewed pull requests, and coordinated co-authors: Anthony Gitter, Casey S. Greene.
Revised specific sub-sections or supervised drafting one or more sub-sections: David J. Harris, Dave DeCaprio, Yanjun Qi, Anshul Kundaje, Yifan Peng, Laura K. Wiley, Marwin H.S. Segler, Simina M. Boca, S. Joshua Swamidass, Austin Huang.
