Several\nresearchers have recently proposed schemes to parallelize SGD, but all require\nperformance-destroying memory locking and synchronization. This work aims to\nshow using novel theoretical analysis, algorithms, and implementation that SGD\ncan be implemented without any locking. We present an update scheme called\nHOGWILD! which allows processors access to shared memory with the possibility\nof overwriting each other's work. We show that when the associated optimization\nproblem is sparse, meaning most gradient updates only modify small parts of the\ndecision variable, then HOGWILD! achieves a nearly optimal rate of convergence.\nWe demonstrate experimentally that HOGWILD! outperforms alternative schemes\nthat use locking by an order of magnitude.",

Here we present a new supervised generative stochastic\nnetwork (GSN) based method to predict local secondary structure with deep\nhierarchical representations. GSN is a recently proposed deep learning\ntechnique (Bengio & Thibodeau-Laufer, 2013) to globally train deep generative\nmodel. We present the supervised extension of GSN, which learns a Markov chain\nto sample from a conditional distribution, and applied it to protein structure\nprediction. To scale the model to full-sized, high-dimensional data, like\nprotein sequences with hundreds of amino acids, we introduce a convolutional\narchitecture, which allows efficient learning across multiple layers of\nhierarchical representations. Our architecture uniquely focuses on predicting\nstructured low-level labels informed with both low and high-level\nrepresentations learned by the model.

We trained\nand tested the model on separate sets of non-homologous proteins sharing less\nthan 30% sequence identity.

    "abstract": "We present a library of efficient implementations of deep learning\nprimitives. Deep learning workloads are computationally intensive, and\noptimizing their kernels is difficult and time-consuming. As parallel\narchitectures evolve, kernels must be reoptimized, which makes maintaining\ncodebases difficult over time. Similar issues have long been addressed in the\nHPC community by libraries such as the Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines (BLAS).\nHowever, there is no analogous library for deep learning. Without such a\nlibrary, researchers implementing deep learning workloads on parallel\nprocessors must create and optimize their own implementations of the main\ncomputational kernels, and this work must be repeated as new parallel\nprocessors emerge. To address this problem, we have created a library similar\nin intent to BLAS, with optimized routines for deep learning workloads. Our\nimplementation contains routines for GPUs, although similarly to the BLAS\nlibrary, these routines could be implemented for other platforms. The library\nis easy to integrate into existing frameworks, and provides optimized\nperformance and memory usage. For example, integrating cuDNN into Caffe, a\npopular framework for convolutional networks, improves performance by 36% on a\nstandard model while also reducing memory consumption.",

A recent study revealed\nthat changing an image (e.g. of a lion) in a way imperceptible to humans can\ncause a DNN to label the image as something else entirely (e.g. mislabeling a\nlion a library).

Specifically, we take\nconvolutional neural networks trained to perform well on either the ImageNet or\nMNIST datasets and then find images with evolutionary algorithms or gradient\nascent that DNNs label with high confidence as belonging to each dataset class.\nIt is possible to produce images totally unrecognizable to human eyes that DNNs\nbelieve with near certainty are familiar objects, which we call \"fooling\nimages\" (more generally, fooling examples).

We present\na novel network architecture, HashedNets, that exploits inherent redundancy in\nneural networks to achieve drastic reductions in model sizes. HashedNets uses a\nlow-cost hash function to randomly group connection weights into hash buckets,\nand all connections within the same hash bucket share a single parameter value.\nThese parameters are tuned to adjust to the HashedNets weight sharing\narchitecture with standard backprop during training. Our hashing procedure\nintroduces no additional memory overhead, and we demonstrate on several\nbenchmark data sets that HashedNets shrink the storage requirements of neural\nnetworks substantially while mostly preserving generalization performance.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a new representation learning approach for domain adaptation, in\nwhich data at training and test time come from similar but different\ndistributions. Our approach is directly inspired by the theory on domain\nadaptation suggesting that, for effective domain transfer to be achieved,\npredictions must be made based on features that cannot discriminate between the\ntraining (source) and test (target) domains. The approach implements this idea\nin the context of neural network architectures that are trained on labeled data\nfrom the source domain and unlabeled data from the target domain (no labeled\ntarget-domain data is necessary). As the training progresses, the approach\npromotes the emergence of features that are (i) discriminative for the main\nlearning task on the source domain and (ii) indiscriminate with respect to the\nshift between the domains. We show that this adaptation behaviour can be\nachieved in almost any feed-forward model by augmenting it with few standard\nlayers and a new gradient reversal layer. The resulting augmented architecture\ncan be trained using standard backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent,\nand can thus be implemented with little effort using any of the deep learning\npackages. We demonstrate the success of our approach for two distinct\nclassification problems (document sentiment analysis and image classification),\nwhere state-of-the-art domain adaptation performance on standard benchmarks is\nachieved. We also validate the approach for descriptor learning task in the\ncontext of person re-identification application.",

Progress in the field will be further\naccelerated by the development of better tools for visualizing and interpreting\nneural nets. We introduce two such tools here.

The second tool enables\nvisualizing features at each layer of a DNN via regularized optimization in\nimage space. Because previous versions of this idea produced less recognizable\nimages, here we introduce several new regularization methods that combine to\nproduce qualitatively clearer, more interpretable visualizations.

We introduce a class of CNNs called deep convolutional\ngenerative adversarial networks (DCGANs), that have certain architectural\nconstraints, and demonstrate that they are a strong candidate for unsupervised\nlearning. Training on various image datasets, we show convincing evidence that\nour deep convolutional adversarial pair learns a hierarchy of representations\nfrom object parts to scenes in both the generator and discriminator.\nAdditionally, we use the learned features for novel tasks - demonstrating their\napplicability as general image representations.",

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of data size and accessibility in recent years has\ninstigated a shift of philosophy in algorithm design for artificial\nintelligence. Instead of engineering algorithms by hand, the ability to learn\ncomposable systems automatically from massive amounts of data has led to\nground-breaking performance in important domains such as computer vision,\nspeech recognition, and natural language processing. The most popular class of\ntechniques used in these domains is called deep learning, and is seeing\nsignificant attention from industry. However, these models require incredible\namounts of data and compute power to train, and are limited by the need for\nbetter hardware acceleration to accommodate scaling beyond current data and\nmodel sizes. While the current solution has been to use clusters of graphics\nprocessing units (GPU) as general purpose processors (GPGPU), the use of field\nprogrammable gate arrays (FPGA) provide an interesting alternative. Current\ntrends in design tools for FPGAs have made them more compatible with the\nhigh-level software practices typically practiced in the deep learning\ncommunity, making FPGAs more accessible to those who build and deploy models.\nSince FPGA architectures are flexible, this could also allow researchers the\nability to explore model-level optimizations beyond what is possible on fixed\narchitectures such as GPUs. As well, FPGAs tend to provide high performance per\nwatt of power consumption, which is of particular importance for application\nscientists interested in large scale server-based deployment or\nresource-limited embedded applications. This review takes a look at deep\nlearning and FPGAs from a hardware acceleration perspective, identifying trends\nand innovations that make these technologies a natural fit, and motivates a\ndiscussion on how FPGAs may best serve the needs of the deep learning community\nmoving forward.",

    "abstract": "Large labeled training sets are the critical building blocks of supervised\nlearning methods and are key enablers of deep learning techniques. For some\napplications, creating labeled training sets is the most time-consuming and\nexpensive part of applying machine learning. We therefore propose a paradigm\nfor the programmatic creation of training sets called data programming in which\nusers express weak supervision strategies or domain heuristics as labeling\nfunctions, which are programs that label subsets of the data, but that are\nnoisy and may conflict. We show that by explicitly representing this training\nset labeling process as a generative model, we can \"denoise\" the generated\ntraining set, and establish theoretically that we can recover the parameters of\nthese generative models in a handful of settings. We then show how to modify a\ndiscriminative loss function to make it noise-aware, and demonstrate our method\nover a range of discriminative models including logistic regression and LSTMs.\nExperimentally, on the 2014 TAC-KBP Slot Filling challenge, we show that data\nprogramming would have led to a new winning score, and also show that applying\ndata programming to an LSTM model leads to a TAC-KBP score almost 6 F1 points\nover a state-of-the-art LSTM baseline (and into second place in the\ncompetition). Additionally, in initial user studies we observed that data\nprogramming may be an easier way for non-experts to create machine learning\nmodels when training data is limited or unavailable.",

    "abstract": "Parallelization framework has become a necessity to speed up the training of\ndeep neural networks (DNN) recently. Such framework typically employs the Model\nAverage approach, denoted as MA-DNN, in which parallel workers conduct\nrespective training based on their own local data while the parameters of local\nmodels are periodically communicated and averaged to obtain a global model\nwhich serves as the new start of local models. However, since DNN is a highly\nnon-convex model, averaging parameters cannot ensure that such global model can\nperform better than those local models. To tackle this problem, we introduce a\nnew parallel training framework called Ensemble-Compression, denoted as EC-DNN.\nIn this framework, we propose to aggregate the local models by ensemble, i.e.,\naveraging the outputs of local models instead of the parameters. As most of\nprevalent loss functions are convex to the output of DNN, the performance of\nensemble-based global model is guaranteed to be at least as good as the average\nperformance of local models. However, a big challenge lies in the explosion of\nmodel size since each round of ensemble can give rise to multiple times size\nincrement. Thus, we carry out model compression after each ensemble,\nspecialized by a distillation based method in this paper, to reduce the size of\nthe global model to be the same as the local ones. Our experimental results\ndemonstrate the prominent advantage of EC-DNN over MA-DNN in terms of both\naccuracy and speedup.",

There is very limited work on exploiting the\nmissing patterns for effective imputation and improving prediction performance.\nIn this paper, we develop novel deep learning models, namely GRU-D, as one of\nthe early attempts. GRU-D is based on Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), a\nstate-of-the-art recurrent neural network. It takes two representations of\nmissing patterns, i.e., masking and time interval, and effectively incorporates\nthem into a deep model architecture so that it not only captures the long-term\ntemporal dependencies in time series, but also utilizes the missing patterns to\nachieve better prediction results.

Computational methods that predict gene expression\nfrom histone modification signals are highly desirable for understanding their\ncombinatorial effects in gene regulation.

Previous studies for quantifying\nthe relationship between histone modifications and gene expression levels\neither failed to capture combinatorial effects or relied on multiple methods\nthat separate predictions and combinatorial analysis. This paper develops a\nunified discriminative framework using a deep convolutional neural network to\nclassify gene expression using histone modification data as input.

To simultaneously visualize the combinatorial interactions\namong histone modifications, we propose a novel optimization-based technique\nthat generates feature pattern maps from the learnt deep model. This provides\nan intuitive description of underlying epigenetic mechanisms that regulate\ngenes.

At present, an important missing\nelement is detecting predictive regular clinical motifs from irregular episodic\nrecords.

Deepr transforms a record into a sequence\nof discrete elements separated by coded time gaps and hospital transfers. On\ntop of the sequence is a convolutional neural net that detects and combines\npredictive local clinical motifs to stratify the risk. Deepr permits\ntransparent inspection and visualization of its inner working. We validate\nDeepr on hospital data to predict unplanned readmission after discharge.

However, it remains unclear how these approaches identify\nmeaningful DNA sequence signals and give insights as to why TFs bind to certain\nlocations. In this paper, we propose a toolkit called the Deep Motif Dashboard\n(DeMo Dashboard) which provides a suite of visualization strategies to extract\nmotifs, or sequence patterns from deep neural network models for TFBS\nclassification. We demonstrate how to visualize and understand three important\nDNN models: convolutional, recurrent, and convolutional-recurrent networks. Our\nfirst visualization method is finding a test sequence's saliency map which uses\nfirst-order derivatives to describe the importance of each nucleotide in making\nthe final prediction. Second, considering recurrent models make predictions in\na temporal manner (from one end of a TFBS sequence to the other), we introduce\ntemporal output scores, indicating the prediction score of a model over time\nfor a sequential input. Lastly, a class-specific visualization strategy finds\nthe optimal input sequence for a given TFBS positive class via stochastic\ngradient optimization. Our experimental results indicate that a\nconvolutional-recurrent architecture performs the best among the three\narchitectures.

Unfortunately, NMT systems are\nknown to be computationally expensive both in training and in translation\ninference. Also, most NMT systems have difficulty with rare words. These issues\nhave hindered NMT's use in practical deployments and services, where both\naccuracy and speed are essential. In this work, we present GNMT, Google's\nNeural Machine Translation system, which attempts to address many of these\nissues. Our model consists of a deep LSTM network with 8 encoder and 8 decoder\nlayers using attention and residual connections. To improve parallelism and\ntherefore decrease training time, our attention mechanism connects the bottom\nlayer of the decoder to the top layer of the encoder. To accelerate the final\ntranslation speed, we employ low-precision arithmetic during inference\ncomputations. To improve handling of rare words, we divide words into a limited\nset of common sub-word units (\"wordpieces\") for both input and output. This\nmethod provides a good balance between the flexibility of \"character\"-delimited\nmodels and the efficiency of \"word\"-delimited models, naturally handles\ntranslation of rare words, and ultimately improves the overall accuracy of the\nsystem. Our beam search technique employs a length-normalization procedure and\nuses a coverage penalty, which encourages generation of an output sentence that\nis most likely to cover all the words in the source sentence. On the WMT'14\nEnglish-to-French and English-to-German benchmarks, GNMT achieves competitive\nresults to state-of-the-art. Using a human side-by-side evaluation on a set of\nisolated simple sentences, it reduces translation errors by an average of 60%\ncompared to Google's phrase-based production system.",

We show that this architecture, dubbed\nXception, slightly outperforms Inception V3 on the ImageNet dataset (which\nInception V3 was designed for), and significantly outperforms Inception V3 on a\nlarger image classification dataset comprising 350 million images and 17,000\nclasses. Since the Xception architecture has the same number of parameters as\nInception V3, the performance gains are not due to increased capacity but\nrather to a more efficient use of model parameters.",

    "abstract": "We propose a technique for producing \"visual explanations\" for decisions from\na large class of CNN-based models, making them more transparent. Our approach -\nGradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), uses the gradients of\nany target concept, flowing into the final convolutional layer to produce a\ncoarse localization map highlighting the important regions in the image for\npredicting the concept. Unlike previous approaches, GradCAM is applicable to a\nwide variety of CNN model-families: (1) CNNs with fully-connected layers (e.g.\nVGG), (2) CNNs used for structured outputs (e.g. captioning), (3) CNNs used in\ntasks with multimodal inputs (e.g. VQA) or reinforcement learning, without any\narchitectural changes or re-training. We combine GradCAM with fine-grained\nvisualizations to create a high-resolution class-discriminative visualization\nand apply it to off-the-shelf image classification, captioning, and visual\nquestion answering (VQA) models, including ResNet-based architectures. In the\ncontext of image classification models, our visualizations (a) lend insights\ninto their failure modes (showing that seemingly unreasonable predictions have\nreasonable explanations), (b) are robust to adversarial images, (c) outperform\nprevious methods on weakly-supervised localization, (d) are more faithful to\nthe underlying model and (e) help achieve generalization by identifying dataset\nbias. For captioning and VQA, our visualizations show that even non-attention\nbased models can localize inputs. Finally, we conduct human studies to measure\nif GradCAM explanations help users establish trust in predictions from deep\nnetworks and show that GradCAM helps untrained users successfully discern a\n\"stronger\" deep network from a \"weaker\" one.

    "abstract": "Deep learning methods exhibit promising performance for predictive modeling\nin healthcare, but two important challenges remain: -Data insufficiency:Often\nin healthcare predictive modeling, the sample size is insufficient for deep\nlearning methods to achieve satisfactory results. -Interpretation:The\nrepresentations learned by deep learning methods should align with medical\nknowledge. To address these challenges, we propose a GRaph-based Attention\nModel, GRAM that supplements electronic health records (EHR) with hierarchical\ninformation inherent to medical ontologies. Based on the data volume and the\nontology structure, GRAM represents a medical concept as a combination of its\nancestors in the ontology via an attention mechanism. We compared predictive\nperformance (i.e. accuracy, data needs, interpretability) of GRAM to various\nmethods including the recurrent neural network (RNN) in two sequential\ndiagnoses prediction tasks and one heart failure prediction task. Compared to\nthe basic RNN, GRAM achieved 10% higher accuracy for predicting diseases rarely\nobserved in the training data and 3% improved area under the ROC curve for\npredicting heart failure using an order of magnitude less training data.\nAdditionally, unlike other methods, the medical concept representations learned\nby GRAM are well aligned with the medical ontology. Finally, GRAM exhibits\nintuitive attention behaviors by adaptively generalizing to higher level\nconcepts when facing data insufficiency at the lower level concepts.",

Recently, several methods have been proposed for interpreting\npredictions from complex models by estimating the importance of input features.\nHere, we present how a model-agnostic additive representation of the importance\nof input features unifies current methods.

A recent paper by Microsoft suggests that we have\nalready achieved human performance. In trying to verify this statement, we\nperformed an independent set of human performance measurements on two\nconversational tasks and found that human performance may be considerably\nbetter than what was earlier reported, giving the community a significantly\nharder goal to achieve.

    "abstract": "There are two major types of uncertainty one can model. Aleatoric uncertainty\ncaptures noise inherent in the observations. On the other hand, epistemic\nuncertainty accounts for uncertainty in the model -- uncertainty which can be\nexplained away given enough data. Traditionally it has been difficult to model\nepistemic uncertainty in computer vision, but with new Bayesian deep learning\ntools this is now possible. We study the benefits of modeling epistemic vs.\naleatoric uncertainty in Bayesian deep learning models for vision tasks. For\nthis we present a Bayesian deep learning framework combining input-dependent\naleatoric uncertainty together with epistemic uncertainty. We study models\nunder the framework with per-pixel semantic segmentation and depth regression\ntasks. Further, our explicit uncertainty formulation leads to new loss\nfunctions for these tasks, which can be interpreted as learned attenuation.\nThis makes the loss more robust to noisy data, also giving new state-of-the-art\nresults on segmentation and depth regression benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "Empirical scoring functions based on either molecular force fields or\ncheminformatics descriptors are widely used, in conjunction with molecular\ndocking, during the early stages of drug discovery to predict potency and\nbinding affinity of a drug-like molecule to a given target. These models\nrequire expert-level knowledge of physical chemistry and biology to be encoded\nas hand-tuned parameters or features rather than allowing the underlying model\nto select features in a data-driven procedure. Here, we develop a general\n3-dimensional spatial convolution operation for learning atomic-level chemical\ninteractions directly from atomic coordinates and demonstrate its application\nto structure-based bioactivity prediction. The atomic convolutional neural\nnetwork is trained to predict the experimentally determined binding affinity of\na protein-ligand complex by direct calculation of the energy associated with\nthe complex, protein, and ligand given the crystal structure of the binding\npose. Non-covalent interactions present in the complex that are absent in the\nprotein-ligand sub-structures are identified and the model learns the\ninteraction strength associated with these features. We test our model by\npredicting the binding free energy of a subset of protein-ligand complexes\nfound in the PDBBind dataset and compare with state-of-the-art cheminformatics\nand machine learning-based approaches. We find that all methods achieve\nexperimental accuracy and that atomic convolutional networks either outperform\nor perform competitively with the cheminformatics based methods. Unlike all\nprevious protein-ligand prediction systems, atomic convolutional networks are\nend-to-end and fully-differentiable. They represent a new data-driven,\nphysics-based deep learning model paradigm that offers a strong foundation for\nfuture improvements in structure-based bioactivity prediction.",

Such examples, typically generated by adding small but\npurposeful distortions, can frequently fool DNN models. Previous studies to\ndefend against adversarial examples mostly focused on refining the DNN models.\nThey have either shown limited success or suffer from the expensive\ncomputation. We propose a new strategy, \\emph{feature squeezing}, that can be\nused to harden DNN models by detecting adversarial examples. Feature squeezing\nreduces the search space available to an adversary by coalescing samples that\ncorrespond to many different feature vectors in the original space into a\nsingle sample. By comparing a DNN model's prediction on the original input with\nthat on the squeezed input, feature squeezing detects adversarial examples with\nhigh accuracy and few false positives. This paper explores two instances of\nfeature squeezing: reducing the color bit depth of each pixel and smoothing\nusing a spatial filter. These strategies are straightforward, inexpensive, and\ncomplementary to defensive methods that operate on the underlying model, such\nas adversarial training.",

    "abstract": "Computational prediction of membrane protein (MP) structures is very\nchallenging partially due to lack of sufficient solved structures for homology\nmodeling. Recently direct evolutionary coupling analysis (DCA) sheds some light\non protein contact prediction and accordingly, contact-assisted folding, but\nDCA is effective only on some very large-sized families since it uses\ninformation only in a single protein family. This paper presents a deep\ntransfer learning method that can significantly improve MP contact prediction\nby learning contact patterns and complex sequence-contact relationship from\nthousands of non-membrane proteins (non-MPs). Tested on 510 non-redundant MPs,\nour deep model (learned from only non-MPs) has top L/10 long-range contact\nprediction accuracy 0.69, better than our deep model trained by only MPs (0.63)\nand much better than a representative DCA method CCMpred (0.47) and the CASP11\nwinner MetaPSICOV (0.55). The accuracy of our deep model can be further\nimproved to 0.72 when trained by a mix of non-MPs and MPs. When only contacts\nin transmembrane regions are evaluated, our method has top L/10 long-range\naccuracy 0.62, 0.57, and 0.53 when trained by a mix of non-MPs and MPs, by\nnon-MPs only, and by MPs only, respectively, still much better than MetaPSICOV\n(0.45) and CCMpred (0.40). All these results suggest that sequence-structure\nrelationship learned by our deep model from non-MPs generalizes well to MP\ncontact prediction. Improved contact prediction also leads to better\ncontact-assisted folding. Using only top predicted contacts as restraints, our\ndeep learning method can fold 160 and 200 of 510 MPs with TMscore>0.6 when\ntrained by non-MPs only and by a mix of non-MPs and MPs, respectively, while\nCCMpred and MetaPSICOV can do so for only 56 and 77 MPs, respectively. Our\ncontact-assisted folding also greatly outperforms homology modeling.",

A tremendous\nnumber of X-ray imaging studies accompanied by radiological reports are\naccumulated and stored in many modern hospitals' Picture Archiving and\nCommunication Systems (PACS). On the other side, it is still an open question\nhow this type of hospital-size knowledge database containing invaluable imaging\ninformatics (i.e., loosely labeled) can be used to facilitate the data-hungry\ndeep learning paradigms in building truly large-scale high precision\ncomputer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems.\n  In this paper, we present a new chest X-ray database, namely \"ChestX-ray8\",\nwhich comprises 108,948 frontal-view X-ray images of 32,717 unique patients\nwith the text-mined eight disease image labels (where each image can have\nmulti-labels), from the associated radiological reports using natural language\nprocessing. Importantly, we demonstrate that these commonly occurring thoracic\ndiseases can be detected and even spatially-located via a unified\nweakly-supervised multi-label image classification and disease localization\nframework, which is validated using our proposed dataset. Although the initial\nquantitative results are promising as reported, deep convolutional neural\nnetwork based \"reading chest X-rays\" (i.e., recognizing and locating the common\ndisease patterns trained with only image-level labels) remains a strenuous task\nfor fully-automated high precision CAD systems.

We then show how\nChemception can serve as a general-purpose neural network architecture for\npredicting toxicity, activity, and solvation properties when trained on a\nmodest database of 600 to 40,000 compounds. When compared to multi-layer\nperceptron (MLP) deep neural networks trained with ECFP fingerprints,\nChemception slightly outperforms in activity and solvation prediction and\nslightly underperforms in toxicity prediction. Having matched the performance\nof expert-developed QSAR/QSPR deep learning models, our work demonstrates the\nplausibility of using deep neural networks to assist in computational chemistry\nresearch, where the feature engineering process is performed primarily by a\ndeep learning algorithm.",

However, they often do not capture their\nown uncertainties well making them less robust in the real world as they\noverconfidently extrapolate and do not notice domain shift. Gaussian processes\n(GPs) with RBF kernels on the other hand have better calibrated uncertainties\nand do not overconfidently extrapolate far from data in their training set.\nHowever, GPs have poor representational power and do not perform as well as\nDNNs on complex domains. In this paper we show that GP hybrid deep networks,\nGPDNNs, (GPs on top of DNNs and trained end-to-end) inherit the nice properties\nof both GPs and DNNs and are much more robust to adversarial examples. When\nextrapolating to adversarial examples and testing in domain shift settings,\nGPDNNs frequently output high entropy class probabilities corresponding to\nessentially \"don't know\". GPDNNs are therefore promising as deep architectures\nthat know when they don't know.",

    "abstract": "The past decade has seen a revolution in genomic technologies that enable a\nflood of genome-wide profiling of chromatin marks. Recent literature tried to\nunderstand gene regulation by predicting gene expression from large-scale\nchromatin measurements. Two fundamental challenges exist for such learning\ntasks: (1) genome-wide chromatin signals are spatially structured,\nhigh-dimensional and highly modular; and (2) the core aim is to understand what\nare the relevant factors and how they work together? Previous studies either\nfailed to model complex dependencies among input signals or relied on separate\nfeature analysis to explain the decisions. This paper presents an\nattention-based deep learning approach; we call AttentiveChrome, that uses a\nunified architecture to model and to interpret dependencies among chromatin\nfactors for controlling gene regulation. AttentiveChrome uses a hierarchy of\nmultiple Long short-term memory (LSTM) modules to encode the input signals and\nto model how various chromatin marks cooperate automatically. AttentiveChrome\ntrains two levels of attention jointly with the target prediction, enabling it\nto attend differentially to relevant marks and to locate important positions\nper mark. We evaluate the model across 56 different cell types (tasks) in\nhuman. Not only is the proposed architecture more accurate, but its attention\nscores also provide a better interpretation than state-of-the-art feature\nvisualization methods such as saliency map.\n  Code and data are shared at www.deepchrome.org",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>With recent advances in high-throughput, automated microscopy, there has been an increased demand for effective computational strategies to analyze large-scale, image-based data. To this end, computer vision approaches have been applied to cell segmentation and feature extraction, whereas machine-learning approaches have been developed to aid in phenotypic classification and clustering of data acquired from biological images. Here, we provide an overview of the commonly used computer vision and machine-learning methods for generating and categorizing phenotypic profiles, highlighting the general biological utility of each approach.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Genes play a central role in all biological processes. DNA microarray technology has made it possible to study the expression behavior of thousands of genes in one go. Often, gene expression data is used to generate features for supervised and unsupervised learning tasks. At the same time, advances in the field of deep learning have made available a plethora of architectures. In this paper, we use deep architectures pre-trained in an unsupervised manner using denoising autoencoders as a preprocessing step for a popular unsupervised learning task. Denoising autoencoders (DA) can be used to learn a compact representation of input, and have been used to generate features for further supervised learning tasks. We propose that our deep architectures can be treated as empirical versions of Deep Belief Networks (DBNs). We use our deep architectures to regenerate gene expression time series data for two different data sets.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Transcriptional enhancers are non-coding segments of DNA that play a central role in the spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression programs. However, systematically and precisely predicting enhancers on a genome-wide scale remain a major challenge. Although existing methods have achieved some success in enhancer prediction, they still suffer from a limited number of training samples, a simplicity of features, class-imbalanced data, and inconsistent performance across diverse cell types/tissues. Here, we developed a deep learning-based algorithmic framework named PEDLA (https://github.com/wenjiegroup/PEDLA), which can directly learn an enhancer predictor from massively heterogeneous data and generalize in ways that are mostly consistent across various cell types/tissues. We first trained PEDLA with 1,114-dimensional heterogeneous features in H1 cells, and we demonstrated that our PEDLA framework integrates diverse heterogeneous features and gives state-of-the-art performance relative to five existing methods for enhancer prediction. We further extended PEDLA to continuously learn from 22 training cell types/tissues, and the results showed that PEDLA manifested superior performance consistency in both training and independent test sets. On average, PEDLA achieved 95.0% accuracy and a 96.8% geometric mean (GM) across 22 training cell types/tissues, as well as 95.7% accuracy and a 96.8% GM across 20 independent test cell types/tissues. Together, our work illustrates the power of harnessing state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to consistently identify regulatory elements at a genome-wide scale from massively heterogeneous data across diverse cell types/tissues.</jats:p>",

Based on rich data resources such as the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) and the Functional Annotation of the Mammalian Genome (FANTOM) projects, we introduce DECRES, the first supervised deep learning approach for the identification of enhancer and promoter regions in the human genome. Due to their ability to discover patterns in large and complex data, the introduction of deep learning methods enables a significant advance in our knowledge of the genomic locations of cis-regulatory regions. Using models for well-characterized cell lines, we identify key experimental features that contribute to the predictive performance. Applying DECRES, we delineate locations of 300,000 candidate enhancers genome wide (6.8% of the genome, of which 40,000 are supported by bidirectional transcription data) and 26,000 candidate promoters (0.6% of the genome).</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Motivation: Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments are commonly used to obtain genome-wide profiles of histone modifications associated with different types of functional genomic elements. However, the quality of histone ChIP-seq data is affected by a myriad of experimental parameters such as the amount of input DNA, antibody specificity, ChIP enrichment, and sequencing depth. Making accurate inferences from chromatin profiling experiments that involve diverse experimental parameters is challenging.  Results: We introduce a convolutional denoising algorithm, Coda, that uses convolutional neural networks to learn a mapping from suboptimal to high-quality histone ChIP-seq data. This overcomes various sources of noise and variability, substantially enhancing and recovering signal when applied to low-quality chromatin profiling datasets across individuals, cell types, and species. Our method has the potential to improve data quality at reduced costs. More broadly, this approach -- using a high-dimensional discriminative model to encode a generative noise process -- is generally applicable to other biological domains where it is easy to generate noisy data but difficult to analytically characterize the noise or underlying data distribution.

State of the art performance is currently achieved by the allele-specific predictor NetMHC and the pan-allele predictor NetMHCpan, both of which are ensembles of shallow neural networks. We explore an intermediate between allele-specific and pan-allele prediction: training allele-specific predictors with synthetic samples generated by imputation of the peptide-MHC affinity matrix. We find that the imputation strategy is useful on alleles with very little training data. We have implemented our predictor as an open-source software package called MHCflurry and show that MHCflurry achieves competitive performance to NetMHC and NetMHCpan.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>To extract patterns from neuroimaging data, various statistical methods and machine learning algorithms have been explored for the diagnosis of Alzheimer′s disease among older adults in both clinical and research applications; however, distinguishing between Alzheimer′s and healthy brain data has been challenging in older adults (age &gt; 75) due to highly similar patterns of brain atrophy and image intensities. Recently, cutting-edge deep learning technologies have rapidly expanded into numerous fields, including medical image analysis. This paper outlines state-of-the-art deep learning-based pipelines employed to distinguish Alzheimer′s magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI) from normal healthy control data for a given age group. Using these pipelines, which were executed on a GPU-based high-performance computing platform, the data were strictly and carefully preprocessed. Next, scale- and shift-invariant low- to high-level features were obtained from a high volume of training images using convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. In this study, fMRI data were used for the first time in deep learning applications for the purposes of medical image analysis and Alzheimer′s disease prediction. These proposed and implemented pipelines, which demonstrate a significant improvement in classification output over other studies, resulted in high and reproducible accuracy rates of 99.9% and 98.84% for the fMRI and MRI pipelines, respectively. Additionally, for clinical purposes, subject-level classification was performed, resulting in an average accuracy rate of 94.32% and 97.88% for the fMRI and MRI pipelines, respectively. Finally, a decision making algorithm designed for the subject-level classification improved the rate to 97.77% for fMRI and 100% for MRI pipelines.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Cross experiment comparisons in public data compendia are challenged by unmatched conditions and technical noise. The ADAGE method, which performs unsupervised integration with neural networks, can effectively identify biological patterns, but because ADAGE models, like many neural networks, are over-parameterized, different ADAGE models perform equally well. To enhance model robustness and better build signatures consistent with biological pathways, we developed an ensemble ADAGE (eADAGE) that integrated stable signatures across models. We applied eADAGE to a Pseudomonas aeruginosa compendium containing experiments performed in 78 media. eADAGE revealed a phosphate starvation response controlled by PhoB. While we expected PhoB activity in limiting phosphate conditions, our analyses found PhoB activity in other media with moderate phosphate and predicted that a second stimulus provided by the sensor kinase, KinB, is required for PhoB activation in this setting. We validated this relationship using both targeted and unbiased genetic approaches. eADAGE, which captures stable biological patterns, enables cross-experiment comparisons that can highlight measured but undiscovered relationships.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>A number of approaches have been developed to call somatic variation in high-throughput sequencing data. Here, we present an adaptive approach to calling somatic variations. Our approach trains a deep feed-forward neural network with semi-simulated data. Semi-simulated datasets are constructed by planting somatic mutations in real datasets where no mutations are expected. Using semi-simulated data makes it possible to train the models with millions of training examples, a usual requirement for successfully training deep learning models. We initially focus on calling variations in RNA-Seq data. We derive semi-simulated datasets from real RNA-Seq data, which offer a good representation of the data the models will be applied to. We test the models on independent semi-simulated data as well as pure simulations. On independent semi-simulated data, models achieve an AUC of 0.973. When tested on semi-simulated exome DNA datasets, we find that the models trained on RNA-Seq data remain predictive (sens ~0.4 &amp; spec ~0.9 at cutoff of P&gt;=0.9), albeit with lower overall performance (AUC=0.737). Interestingly, while the models generalize across assay, training on RNA-Seq data lowers the confidence for a group of mutations. Haloplex exome specific training was also performed, demonstrating that the approach can produce probabilistic models tuned for specific assays and protocols. We found that the method adapts to the characteristics of experimental protocol. We further illustrate these points by training a model for a trio somatic experimental design when germline DNA of both parents is available in addition to data about the individual. These models are distributed with Goby (http://goby.campagnelab.org).</jats:p>",

We demonstrate this by reconstructing the cell cycle of Jurkat cells and disease progression in diabetic retinopathy. In further analysis of Jurkat cells, we detect and separate a subpopulation of dead cells in an unsupervised manner and, in classifying discrete cell cycle stages, we reach a 6-fold reduction in error rate compared to a recent approach based on boosting on image features. In contrast to previous methods, deep learning based predictions are fast enough for on-the-fly analysis in an imaging flow cytometer.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Numerous advances in sequencing technologies have revolutionized genomics through generating many types of genomic functional data. Statistical tools have been developed to analyze individual data types, but there lack strategies to integrate disparate datasets under a unified framework. Moreover, most analysis techniques heavily rely on feature selection and data preprocessing which increase the difficulty of addressing biological questions through the integration of multiple datasets. Here, we introduce FIDDLE (Flexible Integration of Data with Deep LEarning) an open source data-agnostic flexible integrative framework that learns a unified representation from multiple data types to infer another data type. As a case study, we use multiple Saccharomyces cerevisiae genomic datasets to predict global transcription start sites (TSS) through the simulation of TSS-seq data. We demonstrate that a type of data can be inferred from other sources of data types without manually specifying the relevant features and preprocessing. We show that models built from multiple genome-wide datasets perform profoundly better than models built from individual datasets. Thus FIDDLE learns the complex synergistic relationship within individual datasets and, importantly, across datasets.</jats:p>",

In medical imaging, algorithmic solutions based on DL have been shown to achieve high performance on tasks that previously required medical experts. However, DL-based solutions for disease detection have been proposed without methods to quantify and control their uncertainty in a decision. In contrast, a physician knows whether she is uncertain about a case and will consult more experienced colleagues if needed. Here we evaluate drop-out based Bayesian uncertainty measures for DL in diagnosing diabetic retinopathy (DR) from fundus images  and show that it captures uncertainty better than straightforward alternatives. Furthermore, we show that uncertainty informed decision referral can improve diagnostic performance. Experiments across different networks, tasks and datasets show robust generalization. Depending on network capacity and task/dataset difficulty, we surpass 85% sensitivity and 80% specificity as recommended by the NHS when referring 0%-20% of the most uncertain decisions for further inspection. We analyse causes of uncertainty by relating intuitions from 2D visualizations to the high-dimensional image space. While uncertainty is sensitive to clinically relevant cases, sensitivity to unfamiliar data samples is task dependent, but can be rendered more robust.</jats:p>",

However, although recently developed high-throughput experimental approaches have allowed us to recognize potential enhancer-promoter interactions genome-wide, it is still largely unknown whether there are sequence-level instructions encoded in our genome that help govern such interactions. Here we report a new computational method (named \"SPEID\") using deep learning models to predict enhancer-promoter interactions based on sequence-based features only, when the locations of putative enhancers and promoters in a particular cell type are given. Our results across six different cell types demonstrate that SPEID is effective in predicting enhancer-promoter interactions as compared to state-of-the-art methods that use non-sequence features from functional genomic signals. This work shows for the first time that sequence-based features alone can reliably predict enhancer-promoter interactions genome-wide, which provides important insights into the sequence determinants for long-range gene regulation.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a rapidly evolving set of technologies that can be used to determine the sequence of an individual's genome by calling genetic variants present in an individual using billions of short, errorful sequence reads. Despite more than a decade of effort and thousands of dedicated researchers, the hand-crafted and parameterized statistical models used for variant calling still produce thousands of errors and missed variants in each genome. Here we show that a deep convolutional neural network can call genetic variation in aligned next-generation sequencing read data by learning statistical relationships (likelihoods) between images of read pileups around putative variant sites and ground-truth genotype calls. This approach, called DeepVariant, outperforms existing tools, even winning the \"highest performance\" award for SNPs in a FDA-administered variant calling challenge. The learned model generalizes across genome builds and even to other species, allowing non-human sequencing projects to benefit from the wealth of human ground truth data. We further show that, unlike existing tools which perform well on only a specific technology, DeepVariant can learn to call variants in a variety of sequencing technologies and experimental designs, from deep whole genomes from 10X Genomics to Ion Ampliseq exomes. DeepVariant represents a significant step from expert-driven statistical modeling towards more automatic deep learning approaches for developing software to interpret biological instrumentation data.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Objective: The advent of Electronic Medical Records (EMR) with large electronic imaging databases along with advances in deep neural networks with machine learning has provided a unique opportunity to achieve milestones in automated image analysis. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is the most commonly obtained imaging modality in ophthalmology and represents a dense and rich dataset when combined with labels derived from the EMR. We sought to determine if deep learning could be utilized to distinguish normal OCT images from images from patients with Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Design: EMR and OCT database study Subjects: Normal and AMD patients who had a macular OCT. Methods: Automated extraction of an OCT imaging database was performed and linked to clinical endpoints from the EMR. OCT macula scans were obtained by Heidelberg Spectralis, and each OCT scan was linked to EMR clinical endpoints extracted from EPIC. The central 11 images were selected from each OCT scan of two cohorts of patients: normal and AMD. Cross-validation was performed using a random subset of patients. Receiver operator curves (ROC) were constructed at an independent image level, macular OCT level, and patient level. Main outcome measure: Area under the ROC. Results: Of a recent extraction of 2.6 million OCT images linked to clinical datapoints from the EMR, 52,690 normal macular OCT images and 48,312 AMD macular OCT images were selected. A deep neural network was trained to categorize images as either normal or AMD. At the image level, we achieved an area under the ROC of 92.78% with an accuracy of 87.63%. At the macula level, we achieved an area under the ROC of 93.83% with an accuracy of 88.98%. At a patient level, we achieved an area under the ROC of 97.45% with an accuracy of 93.45%. Peak sensitivity and specificity with optimal cutoffs were 92.64% and 93.69% respectively. Conclusions: Deep learning techniques achieve high accuracy and is effective as a new image classification technique. These findings have important implications in utilizing OCT in automated screening and the development of computer aided diagnosis tools in the future.</jats:p>",

This is primarily due to clinical trial failure rates reaching up to 95% in oncology and other disease areas. We have developed a comprehensive analytical and computational pipeline utilizing deep learning techniques and novel systems biology analytical tools to predict the outcomes of phase I/II clinical trials. The pipeline predicts the side effects of a drug using deep neural networks and estimates drug-induced pathway activation. It then uses the predicted side effect probabilities and pathway activation scores as an input to train a classifier which predicts clinical trial outcomes. This classifier was trained on 577 transcriptomic datasets and has achieved a cross-validated accuracy of 0.83. When compared to a direct gene-based classifier, our multi-stage approach dramatically improves the accuracy of the predictions. The classifier was applied to a set of compounds currently present in the pipelines of several major pharmaceutical companies to highlight potential risks in their portfolios and estimate the fraction of clinical trials that were likely to fail in phase I and II.</jats:p>",

Inspired by the success of using deep convolutional features for natural image analysis and conditional random fields (CRF) for structural learning, we propose an end-to-end network for mammographic mass segmentation. The network employs a fully convolutional network (FCN) to model potential function, followed by a CRF to perform structural learning. Because the mass distribution varies greatly with pixel position, the FCN is combined with position priori for the task. Due to the small size of mammogram datasets, we use adversarial training to control over-fitting. Four models with different convolutional kernels are further fused to improve the segmentation results. Experimental results on two public datasets, INbreast and DDSM-BCRP, show that our end-to-end network combined with adversarial training achieves the-state-of-the-art results.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Mammogram classification is directly related to computer-aided diagnosis of breast cancer. Traditional methods requires great effort to annotate the training data by costly manual labeling and specialized computational models to detect these annotations during test. Inspired by the success of using deep convolutional features for natural image analysis and multi-instance learning for labeling a set of instances/patches, we propose end-to-end trained deep multi-instance networks for mass classification based on whole mammogram without the aforementioned costly need to annotate the training data. We explore three different schemes to construct deep multi-instance networks for whole mammogram classification. Experimental results on the INbreast dataset demonstrate the robustness of proposed deep networks compared to previous work using segmentation and detection annotations in the training.</jats:p>",

However, deep learning architectures used thus far in genomics are often directly ported from computer vision and natural language processing applications with few, if any, domain-specific modifications. In double-stranded DNA, the same pattern may appear identically on one strand and its reverse complement due to complementary base pairing. Here, we show that conventional deep learning models that do not explicitly model this property can produce substantially different predictions on forward and reverse-complement versions of the same DNA sequence. We present four new convolutional neural network layers that leverage the reverse-complement property of genomic DNA sequence by sharing parameters between forward and reverse-complement representations in the model. These layers guarantee that forward and reverse-complement sequences produce identical predictions within numerical precision. Using experiments on simulated and in vivo transcription factor binding data, we show that our proposed architectures lead to improved performance, faster learning and cleaner internal representations compared to conventional architectures trained on the same data.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Advancements in sequencing technologies have highlighted the role of alternative splicing (AS) in increasing transcriptome complexity. This role of AS, combined with the relation of aberrant splicing to malignant states, motivated two streams of research, experimental and computational. The first involves a myriad of techniques such as RNA-Seq and CLIP-Seq to identify splicing regulators and their putative targets. The second involves probabilistic models, also known as splicing codes, which infer regulatory mechanisms and predict splicing outcome directly from genomic sequence. To date, these models have utilized only expression data. In this work we address two related challenges: Can we improve on previous models for AS outcome prediction and can we integrate additional sources of data to improve predictions for AS regulatory factors. We perform a detailed comparison of two previous modeling approaches, Bayesian and Deep Neural networks, dissecting the confounding effects of datasets and target functions. We then develop a new target function for AS prediction and show that it significantly improves model accuracy. Next, we develop a modeling framework to incorporate CLIP-Seq, knockdown and over-expression experiments, which are inherently noisy and suffer from missing values. Using several datasets involving key splice factors in mouse brain, muscle and heart we demonstrate both the prediction improvements and biological insights offered by our new models. Overall, the framework we propose offers a scalable integrative solution to improve splicing code modeling as vast amounts of relevant genomic data become available.\n\nAvailability: code and data will be available on Github following publication.</jats:p>",

Interpreting deep neural networks, however, currently remains elusive, and a critical challenge lies in understanding which meaningful features a network is actually learning. We present a general method for interpreting deep neural networks and extracting network-learned features from input data. We describe our algorithm in the context of biological sequence analysis. Our approach, based on ideas from statistical physics, samples from the maximum entropy distribution over possible sequences, anchored at an input sequence and subject to constraints implied by the empirical function learned by a network. Using our framework, we demonstrate that local transcription factor binding motifs can be identified from a network trained on ChIP-seq data and that nucleosome positioning signals are indeed learned by a network trained on chemical cleavage nucleosome maps. Imposing a further constraint on the maximum entropy distribution also allows us to probe whether a network is learning global sequence features, such as the high GC content in nucleosome-rich regions. This work thus provides valuable mathematical tools for interpreting and extracting learned features from feed- forward neural networks.</jats:p>",

We present Monocle 2, which uses reversed graph embedding to reconstruct single-cell trajectories in a fully unsupervised manner. Monocle 2 learns an explicit principal graph to describe the data, greatly improving the robustness and accuracy of its trajectories compared to other algorithms. Monocle 2 uncovered a new, alternative cell fate in what we previously reported to be a linear trajectory for differentiating myoblasts. We also reconstruct branched trajectories for two studies of blood development, and show that loss of function mutations in key lineage transcription factors diverts cells to alternative branches on the a trajectory. Monocle 2 is thus a powerful tool for analyzing cell fate decisions with single-cell genomics.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Identifying robust survival subgroups of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) will significantly improve patient care. Currently, endeavor of integrating multi-omics data to explicitly predict HCC survival from multiple patient cohorts is lacking. To fill in this gap, we present a deep learning (DL) based model on HCC that robustly differentiates survival subpopulations of patients in six cohorts. We build the DL based, survival-sensitive model on 360 HCC patients' data using RNA-seq, miRNA-seq and methylation data from TCGA, which predicts prognosis as good as an alternative model where genomics and clinical data are both considered. This DL based model provides two optimal subgroups of patients with significant survival differences (P=7.13e-6) and good model fitness (C-index=0.68). More aggressive subtype is associated with frequent TP53 inactivation mutations, higher expression of stemness markers (KRT19, EPCAM) and tumor marker BIRC5, and activated Wnt and Akt signaling pathways. We validated this multi-omics model on five external datasets of various omics types: LIRI-JP cohort (n=230, C-index=0.75), NCI cohort (n=221, C-index=0.67), Chinese cohort (n=166, C-index=0.69), E-TABM-36 cohort (n=40, C-index=0.77), and Hawaiian cohort (n=27, C-index=0.82). This is the first study to employ deep learning to identify multi-omics features linked to the differential survival of HCC patients. Given its robustness over multiple cohorts, we expect this workflow to be useful at predicting HCC prognosis prediction.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Motivation: Reconstructing the full-length expressed transcripts (a.k.a. the transcript assembly problem) from the short sequencing reads produced by RNA-seq protocol plays a central role in identifying novel genes and transcripts as well as in studying gene expressions and gene functions. A crucial step in transcript assembly is to accurately determine the splicing junctions and boundaries of the expressed transcripts from the reads alignment. In contrast to the splicing junctions that can be efficiently detected from spliced reads, the problem of identifying boundaries remains open and challenging, due to the fact that the signal related to boundaries is noisy and weak.\n\nResults: We present DeepBound, an effective approach to identify boundaries of expressed transcripts from RNA-seq reads alignment. In its core DeepBound employs deep convolutional neural fields to learn the hidden distributions and patterns of boundaries. To accurately model the transition probabilities and to solve the label-imbalance problem, we novelly incorporate the AUC (area under the curve) score into the optimizing objective function. To address the issue that deep probabilistic graphical models requires large number of labeled training samples, we propose to use simulated RNA-seq datasets to train our model. Through extensive experimental studies on both simulation datasets of two species and biological datasets, we show that DeepBound consistently and significantly outperforms the two existing methods. \n\nAvailability: DeepBound is freely available at https://github.com/realbigws/DeepBound. \n\nContact: mingfu.shao@cs.cmu.edu, realbigws@gmail.com</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The goal of computational neuroscience is to find mechanistic explanations of how the nervous system processes information to support cognitive function and behaviour. At the heart of the field are its models, i.e. mathematical and computational descriptions of the system being studied. These models typically map sensory stimuli to neural responses and/or neural to behavioural responses and range for simple to complex. Recently, deep neural networks (DNNs), using either feedforward and recurrent architectures, have come to dominate several domains of artificial intelligence (AI). As the term “neural network” suggests, these models are inspired by biological brains. However, current DNN models abstract from many details of biological neural networks. Their abstractions contribute to their computational efficiency, enabling to perform complex feats of intelligence, ranging from perceptual tasks (e.g. visual object and auditory speech recognition) to cognitive tasks (e.g. machine translation), and on to motor control tasks (e.g. playing computer games or controlling a robot arm). In addition to their ability to model complex intelligent behaviours, DNNs have been shown to predict neural responses to novel sensory stimuli that cannot be predicted with any other currently available type of model. DNNs can have millions of parameters (connection strengths), which are required to capture the domain knowledge needed for task performance. These parameters are often set by task training using stochastic gradient descent. The computational properties of the units are the result of four directly manipulable elements: input statistics, network structure, functional objective, and learning algorithm. The advances with neural nets in engineering provide the technological basis for building task-performing models of varying degrees of biological realism that promise substantial insights for computational neuroscience.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Convolutional neural networks are rapidly gaining popularity in regulatory genomics. Typically, these networks have a stack of convolutional and pooling layers, followed by one or more fully connected layers. In genomics, the same positional patterns are often present across multiple convolutional channels. Therefore, in current state-of-the-art networks, there exists significant redundancy in the representations learned by standard fully connected layers. We present a new separable fully connected layer that learns a weights tensor that is the outer product of positional weights and cross-channel weights, thereby allowing the same positional patterns to be applied across multiple convolutional channels. Decomposing positional and cross-channel weights further enables us to readily impose biologically-inspired constraints on positional weights, such as symmetry. We also propose a novel regularizer and constraint that act on curvature in the positional weights. Using experiments on simulated and in vivo datasets, we show that networks that incorporate our separable fully connected layer outperform conventional models with analogous architectures and the same number of parameters. Additionally, our networks are more robust to hyperparameter tuning, have more informative gradients, and produce importance scores that are more consistent with known biology than conventional deep neural networks.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Due to the large numbers of transcription factors (TFs) and cell types, querying binding profiles of all TF/cell type pairs is not experimentally feasible, owing to constraints in time and resources. To address this issue, we developed a convolutional-recurrent neural network model, called FactorNet, to computationally impute the missing binding data. FactorNet trains on binding data from reference cell types to make accurate predictions on testing cell types by leveraging a variety of features, including genomic sequences, genome annotations, gene expression, and single-nucleotide resolution sequential signals, such as DNase I cleavage. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first deep learning method to study the rules governing TF binding at such a fine resolution. With FactorNet, a researcher can perform a single sequencing assay, such as DNase-seq, on a cell type and computationally impute dozens of TF binding profiles. This is an integral step for reconstructing the complex networks underlying gene regulation. While neural networks can be computationally expensive to train, we introduce several novel strategies to significantly reduce the overhead. By visualizing the neural network models, we can interpret how the model predicts binding which in turn reveals additional insights into regulatory grammar. We also investigate the variables that affect cross-cell type predictive performance to explain why the model performs better on some TF/cell types than others, and offer insights to improve upon this field. Our method ranked among the top four teams in the ENCODE-DREAM in vivo Transcription Factor Binding Site Prediction Challenge.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Neuroscience is experiencing a data revolution in which simultaneous recording of many hundreds or thousands of neurons is revealing structure in population activity that is not apparent from single-neuron responses. This structure is typically extracted from trial-averaged data. Single-trial analyses are challenging due to incomplete sampling of the neural population, trial-to-trial variability, and fluctuations in action potential timing. Here we introduce Latent Factor Analysis via Dynamical Systems (LFADS), a deep learning method to infer latent dynamics from single-trial neural spiking data. LFADS uses a nonlinear dynamical system (a recurrent neural network) to infer the dynamics underlying observed population activity and to extract ‘de-noised’ single-trial firing rates from neural spiking data. We apply LFADS to a variety of monkey and human motor cortical datasets, demonstrating its ability to predict observed behavioral variables with unprecedented accuracy, extract precise estimates of neural dynamics on single trials, infer perturbations to those dynamics that correlate with behavioral choices, and combine data from non-overlapping recording sessions (spanning months) to improve inference of underlying dynamics. In summary, LFADS leverages all observations of a neural population's activity to accurately model its dynamics on single trials, opening the door to a detailed understanding of the role of dynamics in performing computation and ultimately driving behavior.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Binding of peptides to Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) proteins is a critical step in immune response. Peptides bound to MHCs are recognized by CD8+ (MHC Class I) and CD4+ (MHC Class II) T-cells. Successful prediction of which peptides will bind to specific MHC alleles would benefit many cancer immunotherapy applications. Currently, supervised machine learning is the leading computational approach to predict peptide-MHC binding, and a number of methods, trained using results of binding assays, have been published. Many clinical researchers are dissatisfied with the sensitivity and specificity of currently available methods and the limited number of alleles for which they can be applied. We evaluated several recent methods to predict peptide-MHC Class I binding affinities and a new method of our own design (MHCnuggets). We used a high-quality benchmark set of 51 alleles, which has been applied previously. The neural network methods NetMHC, NetMHCpan, MHCflurry, and MHCnuggets achieved similar best-in-class prediction performance in our testing, and of these methods MHCnuggets was significantly faster. MHCnuggets is a gated recurrent neural network, and the only method to our knowledge which can handle peptides of any length, without artificial lengthening and shortening. Seventeen alleles were problematic for all tested methods. Prediction difficulties could be explained by deficiencies in the training and testing examples in the benchmark, suggesting that biological differences in allele-specific binding properties are not as important as previously claimed. Advances in accuracy and speed of computational methods to predict peptide-MHC affinity are urgently needed. These methods will be at the core of pipelines to identify patients who will benefit from immunotherapy, based on tumor-derived somatic mutations. Machine learning methods, such as MHCnuggets, which efficiently handle peptides of any length will be increasingly important for the challenges of predicting immunogenic response for MHC Class II alleles.</jats:p>",

We train deep neural networks that generate synthetic subjects closely resembling study participants. Using the SPRINT trial as an example, we show that machine-learning models built from simulated participants generalize to the original dataset. We incorporate differential privacy, which offers strong guarantees on the likelihood that a subject could be identified as a member of the trial. Investigators who have compiled a dataset can use our method to provide a freely accessible public version that enables other scientists to perform discovery-oriented analyses.

We describe and benchmark a new open-source MHC I binding prediction package, MHCflurry. The software is a collection of allele-specific binding predictors incorporating a novel neural network architecture and adhering to software development best practices. MHCflurry outperformed the standard predictors NetMHC 4.0 and NetMHCpan 3.0 on a benchmark of mass spec-identified MHC ligands and showed competitive accuracy on a benchmark of affinity measurements. The accuracy improvement was due to substantially better prediction of non-9-mer peptide ligands, which offset a narrowly lower accuracy on 9-mers. MHCflurry was on average 8.6X faster than NetMHC and 44X faster than NetMHCpan; performance is further increased when a graphics processing unit (GPU) is available. MHCflurry is freely available to use, retrain, or extend, includes Python library and command line interfaces, and may be installed using standard package managers.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has profiled over 10,000 tumors across 33 different cancer-types for many genomic features, including gene expression levels. Gene expression measurements capture substantial information about the state of each tumor. Certain classes of deep neural network models are capable of learning a meaningful latent space. Such a latent space could be used to explore and generate hypothetical gene expression profiles under various types of molecular and genetic perturbation. For example, one might wish to use such a model to predict a tumor's response to specific therapies or to characterize complex gene expression activations existing in differential proportions in different tumors. Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are a deep neural network approach capable of generating meaningful latent spaces for image and text data. In this work, we sought to determine the extent to which a VAE can be trained to model cancer gene expression, and whether or not such a VAE would capture biologically-relevant features. In the following report, we introduce a VAE trained on TCGA pan-cancer RNA-seq data, identify specific patterns in the VAE encoded features, and discuss potential merits of the approach. We name our method \"Tybalt\" after an instigative, cat-like character who sets a cascading chain of events in motion in Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. From a systems biology perspective, Tybalt could one day aid in cancer stratification or predict specific activated expression patterns that would result from genetic changes or treatment effects.</jats:p>",

However, dimension reduction to interpret structure in single-cell sequencing data re- mains a challenge. Existing algorithms are either not able to uncover the clustering structures in the data, or lose global information such as groups of clusters the are close to each other. We present a robust statistical model, scvis to capture and visualize the low-dimensional structures in single-cell gene expression data. Simulation results demonstrate that low-dimensional representations learned by scvis preserve both the local and global neighbour structures in the data. In addition, scvis is robust to the number of data points and learns a probabilistic parametric mapping function to add new data points to an existing embedding. We then use scvis to analyze four single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets, exemplifying interpretable two-dimensional representations of the high-dimensional single-cell RNA-sequencing data.</jats:p>",

By exploiting large sets of sequences with known phenotypes, machine learning methods can be used to build functions that predict the phenotype of new, unannotated sequences. In particular, deep neural networks have recently obtained good performances on such prediction tasks, but are notoriously difficult to analyze or interpret. Here, we introduce a hybrid approach between kernel methods and convolutional neural networks for sequences, which retains the ability of neural networks to learn good representations for a learning problem at hand, while defining a well characterized Hilbert space to describe prediction functions. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks on a transcription factor binding prediction task while being much faster to train and yielding more stable and interpretable results.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>\n          The prevalence of high-throughput experimental methods has resulted in an abundance of large-scale molecular and functional interaction networks. The connectivity of these networks provide a rich source of information for inferring functional annotations for genes and proteins. An important challenge has been to develop methods for combining these heterogeneous networks to extract useful protein feature representations for function prediction. Most of the existing approaches for network integration use shallow models that cannot capture complex and highly-nonlinear network structures. Thus, we propose\n          <jats:italic>deepNF</jats:italic>\n          , a network fusion method based on\n          <jats:italic>Multimodal Deep Autoencoders</jats:italic>\n          to extract high-level features of proteins from multiple heterogeneous interaction networks. We apply this method to combine STRING networks to construct a common low-dimensional representation containing high-level protein features. We use separate layers for different network types in the early stages of the multimodal autoencoder, later connecting all the layers into a single bottleneck layer from which we extract features to predict protein function. We compare the cross-validation and temporal holdout predictive performance of our method with state-of-the-art methods, including the recently proposed method\n          <jats:italic>Mashup</jats:italic>\n          . Our results show that our method outperforms previous methods for both human and yeast STRING networks. We also show substantial improvement in the  performance of our method in predicting GO terms of varying type and specificity.\n        </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Computational prediction of cell type-specific, in-vivo transcription factor binding sites is still one of the central challenges in regulatory genomics, and a variety of approaches has been proposed for this purpose. Here, we present our approach that earned a shared first rank in the \"ENCODE-DREAM in vivo Transcription Factor Binding Site Prediction Challenge\" in 2017. This approach employs an extensive set of features derived from chromatin accessibility, binding motifs, gene expression, sequence and annotation to train classifiers using a supervised, discriminative learning principle. Two further key aspects of this approach is learning classifier parameters in an iterative training procedure that successively adds additional negative examples to the training set, and creating an ensemble prediction by averaging over classifiers obtained for different training cell types. In post-challenge analyses, we benchmark the influence of different feature sets and find that chromatin accessiblity and binding motifs are sufficient to yield state-of-the-art performance for in-vivo binding site predictions. We also show that the iterative training procedure and the ensemble prediction are pivotal for the final prediction performance. To make predictions of this approach readily accessible, we predict 682 peak lists for a total of 31 transcription factors in 22 primary cell types and tissues, which are available for download at https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn11526239, and we demonstrate that these predictions may help to yield biological conclusions.</jats:p>",

The dataset for this competition is consisted of 12.6k radiological images. Each radiograph in this dataset is an image of a left hand labeled by the bone age and the sex of a patient. Our approach utilizes several deep neural network architectures trained end-to-end. We use images of whole hands as well as specific parts of a hand for both training and inference. This approach allows us to measure the importance of specific hand bones for the automated bone age analysis. We further evaluate performance of the method in the context of skeletal development stages. Our approach outperforms other common methods for bone age assessment.</jats:p>",

Early diagnostics significantly increases the chances of correct treatment and survival, but this process is tedious and often leads to a disagreement between pathologists. Computer-aided diagnosis systems showed potential for improving the diagnostic accuracy.

Hematoxylin and eosin stained breast histology microscopy image dataset is provided as a part of the ICIAR 2018 Grand Challenge on Breast Cancer Histology Images. Our approach utilizes several deep neural network architectures and gradient boosted trees classifier. For 4-class classification task, we report 87.2% accuracy. For 2-class classification task to detect carcinomas we report 93.8% accuracy, AUC 97.3%, and sensitivity/specificity 96.5/88.0% at the high-sensitivity operating point. To our knowledge, this approach outperforms other common methods in automated histopathological image classification.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Accurate prediction of protein structure is one of the central challenges of biochemistry. Despite significant progress made by co-evolution methods to predict protein structure from signatures of residue-residue coupling found in the evolutionary record, a direct and explicit mapping between protein sequence and structure remains elusive, with no substantial recent progress. Meanwhile, rapid developments in deep learning, which have found remarkable success in computer vision, natural language processing, and quantum chemistry raise the question of whether a deep learning based approach to protein structure could yield similar advancements. A key ingredient of the success of deep learning is the reformulation of complex, human-designed, multi-stage pipelines with differentiable models that can be jointly optimized end-to-end. We report the development of such a model, which reformulates the entire structure prediction pipeline using differentiable primitives. Achieving this required combining four technical ideas: (1) the adoption of a recurrent neural architecture to encode the internal representation of protein sequence, (2) the parameterization of (local) protein structure by torsional angles, which provides a way to reason over protein conformations without violating the covalent chemistry of protein chains, (3) the coupling of local protein structure to its global representation via recurrent geometric units, and (4) the use of a differentiable loss function to capture deviations between predicted and experimental structures. To our knowledge this is the first end-to-end differentiable model for learning of protein structure. We test the effectiveness of this approach using two challenging tasks: the prediction of novel protein folds without the use of co-evolutionary information, and the prediction of known protein folds without the use of structural templates. On the first task the model achieves state-of-the-art performance, even when compared to methods that rely on co-evolutionary data. On the second task the model is competitive with methods that use experimental protein structures as templates, achieving 3-7Å accuracy despite being template-free. Beyond protein structure prediction, end-to-end differentiable models of proteins represent a new paradigm for learning and modeling protein structure, with potential applications in docking, molecular dynamics, and protein design.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>We compare and contrast genome-wide compositional biases and distributions of short oligonucleotides across 15 diverse prokaryotes that have substantial genomic sequence collections. These include seven complete genomes (Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803, Methanococcus jannaschii, and Pyrobaculum aerophilum). A key observation concerns the constancy of the dinucleotide relative abundance profiles over multiple 50-kb disjoint contigs within the same genome. (The profile is rhoXY* = fXY*/fX*fY* for all XY, where fX* denotes the frequency of the nucleotide X and fY* denotes the frequency of the dinucleotide XY, both computed from the sequence concatenated with its inverted complementary sequence.) On the basis of this constancy, we refer to the collection [rhoXY*] as the genome signature. We establish that the differences between [rhoXY*] vectors of 50-kb sample contigs of different genomes virtually always exceed the differences between those of the same genomes. Various di- and tetranucleotide biases are identified. In particular, we find that the dinucleotide CpG=CG is underrepresented in many thermophiles (e.g., M. jannaschii, Sulfolobus sp., and M. thermoautotrophicum) but overrepresented in halobacteria. TA is broadly underrepresented in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, but normal counts appear in Sulfolobus and P. aerophilum sequences. More than for any other bacterial genome, palindromic tetranucleotides are underrepresented in H. influenzae. The M. jannaschii sequence is unprecedented in its extreme underrepresentation of CTAG tetranucleotides and in the anomalous distribution of CTAG sites around the genome. Comparative analysis of numbers of long tetranucleotide microsatellites distinguishes H. influenzae. Dinucleotide relative abundance differences between bacterial sequences are compared. For example, in these assessments of differences, the cyanobacteria Synechocystis, Synechococcus, and Anabaena do not form a coherent group and are as far from each other as general gram-negative sequences are from general gram-positive sequences. The difference of M. jannaschii from low-G+C gram-positive proteobacteria is one-half of the difference from gram-negative proteobacteria. Interpretations and hypotheses center on the role of the genome signature in highlighting similarities and dissimilarities across different classes of prokaryotic species, possible mechanisms underlying the genome signature, the form and level of genome compositional flux, the use of the genome signature as a chronometer of molecular phylogeny, and implications with respect to the three putative eubacterial, archaeal, and eukaryote domains of life and to the origin and early evolution of eukaryotes.</jats:p>",

We present an unsupervised machine learning approach, ADAGE (<jats:italic>a</jats:italic>nalysis using<jats:italic>d</jats:italic>enoising<jats:italic>a</jats:italic>utoencoders of<jats:italic>g</jats:italic>ene<jats:italic>e</jats:italic>xpression), and apply it to the publicly available gene expression data compendium for<jats:italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</jats:italic>. In this approach, the machine-learned ADAGE model contained 50 nodes which we predicted would correspond to gene expression patterns across the gene expression compendium. While no biological knowledge was used during model construction, cooperonic genes had similar weights across nodes, and genes with similar weights across nodes were significantly more likely to share KEGG pathways. By analyzing newly generated and previously published microarray and transcriptome sequencing data, the ADAGE model identified differences between strains, modeled the cellular response to low oxygen, and predicted the involvement of biological processes based on low-level gene expression differences. ADAGE compared favorably with traditional principal component analysis and independent component analysis approaches in its ability to extract validated patterns, and based on our analyses, we propose that these approaches differ in the types of patterns they preferentially identify. We provide the ADAGE model with analysis of all publicly available<jats:italic>P. aeruginosa</jats:italic>GeneChip experiments and open source code for use with other species and settings. Extraction of consistent patterns across large-scale collections of genomic data using methods like ADAGE provides the opportunity to identify general principles and biologically important patterns in microbial biology. This approach will be particularly useful in less-well-studied microbial species.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>The quantity and breadth of genome-scale data sets that examine RNA expression in diverse bacterial and eukaryotic species are increasing more rapidly than for curated knowledge.

Various machine learning-based approaches have been applied to BNER tasks and showed good performance. In this paper, we systematically investigated three different types of word representation (WR) features for BNER, including clustering-based representation, distributional representation, and word embeddings. We selected one algorithm from each of the three types of WR features and applied them to the JNLPBA and BioCreAtIvE II BNER tasks. Our results showed that all the three WR algorithms were beneficial to machine learning-based BNER systems. Moreover, combining these different types of WR features further improved BNER performance, indicating that they are complementary to each other. By combining all the three types of WR features, the improvements in<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math>-measure on the BioCreAtIvE II GM and JNLPBA corpora were 3.75% and 1.39%, respectively, when compared with the systems using baseline features. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically evaluate the effect of three different types of WR features for BNER tasks.</jats:p>",

In this paper, we tackle PPI extraction by using convolutional neural networks (CNN) and propose a shortest dependency path based CNN (sdpCNN) model. The proposed method<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"><mml:mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mml:mo><mml:mn fontstyle=\"italic\">1</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mml:mo></mml:math>only takes the sdp and word embedding as input and<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M2\"><mml:mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mml:mo><mml:mn fontstyle=\"italic\">2</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mml:mo></mml:math>could avoid bias from feature selection by using CNN. We performed experiments on standard Aimed and BioInfer datasets, and the experimental results demonstrated that our approach outperformed state-of-the-art kernel based methods. In particular, by tracking the sdpCNN model, we find that sdpCNN could extract key features automatically and it is verified that pretrained word embedding is crucial in PPI task.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Owing to the complexity and variability of metagenomic studies, modern machine learning approaches have seen increased usage to answer a variety of question encompassing the full range of metagenomic NGS data analysis.We review here the contribution of machine learning techniques for the field of metagenomics, by presenting known successful approaches in a unified framework. This review focuses on five important metagenomic problems:OTU-clustering, binning, taxonomic proffiing and assignment, comparative metagenomics and gene prediction. For each of these problems, we identify the most prominent methods, summarize the machine learning approaches used and put them into perspective of similar methods.We conclude our review looking further ahead at the challenge posed by the analysis of interactions within microbial communities and different environments, in a field one could call “integrative metagenomics”.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Sample size calculation is part of the early stages of conducting an epidemiological, clinical or lab study. In preparing a scientific paper, there are ethical and methodological indications for its use. Two investigations conducted with the same methodology and achieving equivalent results, but different only in terms of sample size, may point the researcher in different directions when it comes to making clinical decisions. Therefore, ideally, samples should not be small and, contrary to what one might think, should not be excessive. The aim of this paper is to discuss in clinical language the main implications of the sample size when interpreting a study.</jats:p>",

However, it is rare for researchers to perform or publish direct replications of existing results. The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is an open investigation of reproducibility in preclinical cancer biology research. We have identified 50 high impact cancer biology articles published in the period 2010-2012, and plan to replicate a subset of experimental results from each article. A Registered Report detailing the proposed experimental designs and protocols for each subset of experiments will be peer reviewed and published prior to data collection. The results of these experiments will then be published in a Replication Study. The resulting open methodology and dataset will provide evidence about the reproducibility of high-impact results, and an opportunity to identify predictors of reproducibility.</jats:p>",

Here, we show that recently reported non-canonical sites do not mediate repression despite binding the miRNA, which indicates that the vast majority of functional sites are canonical. Accordingly, we developed an improved quantitative model of canonical targeting, using a compendium of experimental datasets that we pre-processed to minimize confounding biases. This model, which considers site type and another 14 features to predict the most effectively targeted mRNAs, performed significantly better than existing models and was as informative as the best high-throughput in vivo crosslinking approaches. It drives the latest version of TargetScan (v7.0; targetscan.org), thereby providing a valuable resource for placing miRNAs into gene-regulatory networks.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The recent advent of methods for high-throughput single-cell molecular profiling\n                    has catalyzed a growing sense in the scientific community that the time is ripe\n                    to complete the 150-year-old effort to identify all cell types in the human\n                    body. The Human Cell Atlas Project is an international collaborative effort that\n                    aims to define all human cell types in terms of distinctive molecular profiles\n                    (such as gene expression profiles) and to connect this information with\n                    classical cellular descriptions (such as location and morphology). An open\n                    comprehensive reference map of the molecular state of cells in healthy human\n                    tissues would propel the systematic study of physiological states, developmental\n                    trajectories, regulatory circuitry and interactions of cells, and also provide a\n                    framework for understanding cellular dysregulation in human disease. Here we\n                    describe the idea, its potential utility, early proofs-of-concept, and some\n                    design considerations for the Human Cell Atlas, including a commitment to open\n                    data, code, and community.</jats:p>",

Beyond the model definitions and the quantitative analyses, there is a need for qualitative comparisons of the solutions learned by various deep architectures. The goal of this paper is to find good qualitative interpretations of high level features represented by such models. To this end, we contrast and compare several techniques applied on Stacked Denoising Autoencoders and Deep Belief Networks, trained on several vision datasets. We show that, perhaps counter-intuitively, such interpretation is possible at the unit level, that it is simple to accomplish and that the results are consistent across various techniques. We hope that such techniques will allow researchers in deep architectures to understand more of how and why deep architectures work",

    "abstract": "Extracting adverse drug events receives much research attention in the biomedical community. Previous work adopts pipeline models, firstly recognizing drug/disease entity mentions and then identifying adverse drug events from drug/disease pairs. In this paper, we investigate joint models for simultaneously extracting drugs, diseases and adverse drug events. Compared with pipeline models, joint models have two main advantages. First, they make use of information integration to facilitate performance improvement; second, they reduce error propagation in pipeline methods. We compare a discrete model and a deep neural model for extracting drugs, diseases and adverse drug events jointly. Experimental results on a standard ADE corpus show that the discrete joint model outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline pipeline significantly. In addition, when discrete features are replaced by neural features, the recall is further improved.",

    "abstract": "We design a novel, communication-efficient, failure-robust protocol for secure aggregation of high-dimensional data. Our protocol allows a server to compute the sum of large, user-held data vectors from mobile devices in a secure manner (i.e. without learning each user's individual contribution), and can be used, for example, in a federated learning setting, to aggregate user-provided model updates for a deep neural network. We prove the security of our protocol in the honest-but-curious and malicious settings, and show that security is maintained even if an arbitrarily chosen subset of users drop out at any time. We evaluate the efficiency of our protocol and show, by complexity analysis and a concrete implementation, that its runtime and communication overhead remain low even on large data sets and client pools. For 16-bit input values, our protocol offerscommunication expansion forusers and-dimensional vectors, andexpansion for\n\nusers and-dimensional vectors over sending data in the clear.",

    "abstract": "Several recent advances to the state of the art in image classification benchmarks have come from better configurations of existing techniques rather than novel approaches to feature learning. Traditionally, hyper-parameter optimization has been the job of humans because they can be very efficient in regimes where only a few trials are possible. Presently, computer clusters and GPU processors make it possible to run more trials and we show that algorithmic approaches can find better results. We present hyper-parameter optimization results on tasks of training neural networks and deep belief networks (DBNs). We optimize hyper-parameters using random search and two new greedy sequential methods based on the expected improvement criterion. Random search has been shown to be sufficiently efficient for learning neural networks for several datasets, but we show it is unreliable for training DBNs. The sequential algorithms are applied to the most difficult DBN learning problems from [1] and find significantly better results than the best previously reported. This work contributes novel techniques for making response surface models P(y|x) in which many elements of hyper-parameter assignment (x) are known to be irrelevant given particular values of other elements.",

    "abstract": "We trained a large, deep convolutional neural network to classify the 1.2 million high-resolution images in the ImageNet LSVRC-2010 contest into the 1000 different classes. On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0% which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully-connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overriding in the fully-connected layers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called \"dropout\" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry.",
