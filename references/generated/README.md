# Generated citation / reference files

The [`references`](https://github.com/greenelab/deep-review/tree/references) branch contains files automatically generated by the manuscript build process.
It consists of the contents of the [`references/generated`](https://github.com/greenelab/deep-review/tree/master/references/generated) directory of the `master` branch.
These files are not tracked in `master`, but instead written to the `references` branch by continuous Travis CI builds.

## Files

This directory contains the following files:

+ [`processed-citations.tsv`](processed-citations.tsv) is a table of references extracted from the manuscript sections and their mapping to standardized citation_ids.
+ [`all-sections.md`](all-sections.md) is a markdown document of all manuscript sections, with references replaced by citation_ids.
+ [`citations.json`](citations.json) is a cache of citation metadata that can include both bibtex and CSL citation records.
+ [`bibliography.bib`](bibliography.bib) is a bibtex bibliography file of a subset of citations.
+ [`bibliography.json`](bibliography.json) is CSL-JSON file of bibliographic item metadata ([see specification](https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/blob/master/csl-data.json)) for all references.

Pandoc consumes `all-sections.md` and `bibliography.json` to create the formatted manuscript.
