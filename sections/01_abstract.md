## Abstract

Deep learning, a new class of machine learning algorithms, has recently showed impressive results across a variety domains. Biomedicine and genomics, both data- and feature-rich and yet complex and ill-understood, presents an obvious target for applying this new approach. We examine applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical data problems - in patient classification, fundamental research and patient treatment -  to determine if similar progress can be made here or what unique challenges the biomedical sphere holds. We find that while deep learning has achieved (sometimes remarkable) advances on prior state-of-the-art methods, it has not yet revolutionized or definitively solved any problem. In some cases, this is probably simply a matter of time but elsewhere technical advances need to be made in the areas of interpretability, unsupervised learning and most generally how to best model a problem. Beyond the technical, the limited amount of (correctly labeled) data available for traing presents problems, as does the legal and privacy constraints enforced by working with health records. Nonetheless, we forsee a growing use of deep learning with potential for transforming some fields of biomedicine.
