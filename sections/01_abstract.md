## Abstract

Deep learning, a class of machine learning algorithms, has recently
showed impressive results across a variety of domains. Biomedicine and genomics,
both data- and feature-rich and yet complex and ill-understood, present an
obvious and potentially valuable target for applying this new approach. We
examine applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical fields --
classification, fundamental research into biology and patient treatment -- to
determine if similar progress can be made here or what unique challenges the
biomedical sphere holds. While finding it has yet to revolutionize or
definitively resolve any domain, promising (and sometimes remarkable) advances
have been made on prior state-of-the-art methods. Technical advances are needed
in the areas of interpretability and how to best model a problem. Beyond the
technical, the limited amount of labeled data available for training presents
problems, as does the legal and privacy constraints enforced by working with
health records. Nonetheless, we foresee a growing use of deep learning with
potential for transforming several fields of biomedicine.
