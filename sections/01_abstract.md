## Abstract

Deep learning, a class of machine learning algorithms, has recently showed
impressive results across a variety of domains. Biomedicine and genomics, both
data- and feature-rich and yet complex and often ill-understood, present an
obvious and potentially valuable target for this new approach. We examine
applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical problems --
classification, fundamental research into biology and patient treatment -- to
determine if similar progress can be made there or if the biomedical sphere
holds unique challenges. While deep learning has yet to revolutionize or
definitively resolve any of these problems, promising (sometimes remarkable)
advances have been made on the prior state-of-the-art. Even where improvement
over the previous baseline has been modest, there is still the promise of
greatly speeding or aiding human investigation. More work is needed in technical
directions such as interpretability and how to best model a problem. Further,
the limited amount of labeled data for training presents problems in some
domains, as can the legal and privacy constraints enforced by working with
sensitive health records. Nonetheless, we foresee a growing use of deep learning
with potential for transforming several fields of biomedicine, coming to routine
use at the bench and bedside.
