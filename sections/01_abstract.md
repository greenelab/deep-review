## Abstract

Deep learning, which describes a class of machine learning algorithms, has recently showed
impressive results across a variety of domains. Biology and medicine are data rich, but the data are
complex and often ill-understood.
Problems of this nature may be particularly well-suited to deep learning techniques.
We examine
applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical problems --
patient classification, fundamental biological processes, and treatment of patients -- to
predict whether deep learning will transform these tasks or if the biomedical sphere
poses unique challenges. We find that deep learning has yet to revolutionize or
definitively resolve any of these problems, but promising
advances have been made on the prior state of the art. Even when improvement
over a previous baseline has been modest, we have seen signs that deep learning methods may
speed or aid human investigation. More work is needed to address concerns
related to interpretability and how to best model each problem. Furthermore,
the limited amount of labeled data for training presents problems in some
domains, as can legal and privacy constraints on work with
sensitive health records. Nonetheless, we foresee deep learning powering changes
at the bench and bedside
with the potential to transform several areas of biology and medicine.
