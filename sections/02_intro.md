## Introduction

### Potential writing prompt

One potential future that we could imagine is a world in which data, once
gathered, is rapidly integrated into our understanding of living systems. What
we learn is rapidly put to use. Our health-related activities are constantly
monitored (e.g. by wearables) and all of our interactions with health care
systems are extensively tracked. These sources of information are combined to
help to guide our health care and maintenance. We'd be able to compare our state
and trajectory to (anonymized) others, and identify means to improve our health.
These means might contain drug combinations selected based on personalized
predictions.

### If this happens, is deep learning required for any of it? Are we any closer
### because of the advent of deep learning?

*"Categorize" and "treat" sound a bit like PMI goals. Another way to think about
this would be: do we think that deep learning will make much of a difference
for the precision medicine initiative (PMI)?*

### General deep learning introduction

*Definitions, specific architectures, etc.  We may want to clarify what we mean
by "deep" learning when most methods use few hidden layers.*

### Types of biological problems

This section could contain the types of biological problems people have already applied deep learning to, based on the existing literature.  This could be mentioned in two ways: 

1. The type of input data: DNA sequence, protein sequence, clinical data, imaging data, etc.
2. The output/objective of the model: protein structure/function, protein localization, miRNA/TF target prediction, patient diagnosis/prognosis, drug discovery/prediction, or unsupervised clustering, etc.
