## Discussion

Despite the disparate types of data and scientific goals in the learning tasks
covered above, several challenges can be seen to be broadly important for deep
learning in the biomedical domain.  Here we examine these factors that may
impede further progress, ask what steps have already been taken to overcome
them, and suggest future research directions.

### Evaluation

*What are the challenges in evaluating deep learning models that are specific to
this domain?  This can include a discussion of ROC versus precision-recall
curves for the imbalanced classes often encountered in biomedical datasets.
It could also mention alternative metrics that are used in specific sub-areas
such as enrichment factors in virtual screening.  A lack of true gold standard
data for some problems complicates both training and evaluation.  Confidence-
weighted labels are valuable when available.*

*Is progress in some biomedical areas slowed when new predictions (e.g. from
generative models) cannot be assessed by any human expert and require
experimental testing?  For example, contrast a painting or song generated by
a GAN versus a novel chemical compound.  Related is the idea that on some tasks
(e.g. the recent wave of deep learning versus MD image classification papers)
it is easy to tell when deep learning has produced a breakthrough because
human-level performance is an impressive baseline.  In many tasks we reviewed,
human-level performance is irrelevant.*

### Interpretation

As the challenge of interpretability is common across many domains, there is
much interest in developing generic procedures for knowledge extraction
from deep models. Ribeiro et al. [@tag:Ribeiro2016_lime] focus on interpreting
individual predictions rather than interpreting the model. By fitting simple
linear models to mimic the predictions of the deep learning model in a small
neighborhood of a data sample, they generated an interpretable model for each
prediction. However, the reliability of these models is unclear.
Theoretical guarantees on the curvature of the predictions of deep learning
models are not known, nor it is unclear whether these predictions
are robust to sample noise. Toward quantifying the uncertainty of
predictions, there has been a renewed interest in confidence intervals for
deep neural networks. Early work from Chryssolouris et al
[@tag:Chryssolouris1996_confidence] provided confidence intervals under the
 assumption of normally distributed error. However, Nguyen et al
 [@tag:Nguyen2014_adversarial] showed that the confidence of convolutional
 neural networks is not reliable; they can output confidence scores over
 99.99% even for samples that are purely noise. Recently, Fong and Vedaldi
 [@tag:Fong2017_perturb] provided a framework for understanding black box
 algorithms by perturbing input data.

For domain-specific models, we previously described approaches for the
interpretation and visualization of neural networks that prediction
transcription factor binding [@tag:Alipanahi2015_predicting
@tag:Lanchantin2016_motif @tag:Shrikumar2016_blackbox]. Other studies have
focused on integrating attention mechanisms with neural networks.
Attention mechanisms dynamically weight the importance the neural network gives
to each feature. By inspecting the attention weights for a particular sample, a
practitioner can identify the important features behind a given prediction.
Elsewhere, to improve interpretability Choi et al. [@tag:Choi2016_retain]
inverted the typical architecture of recurrent neural networks.
In particular, they only used
recurrent connections in the attention generating procedure, leaving the hidden
state directly connected to the input variables. In the clinical domain, this
model was able to produce accurate diagnoses in which the contribution of
previous hospital visits could be directly interpreted. Choi et al
later extended this work [@tag:Choi2016_gram]  to take into account the
structure
of disease ontologies, finding that the concepts represented by the model were
aligned with medical knowledge. Finally, Che et al. [@tag:Che2015_distill]
introduced a
knowledge-distillation approach which used gradient boosted trees to learn
interpretable healthcare features from trained deep models.

### Data limitations

A lack of large-scale, high-quality, correctly labeled training data has
impacted deep
learning in nearly all applications we have discussed, from healthcare to
genomics to drug discovery.  The challenges of training complex, high-parameter
neural networks from few examples are obvious, but uncertainty in the labels of
those examples can be just as problematic.  For example, in genomics
labeled data may be derived from an experimental assay with known and
unknown technical artifacts, biases, and error profiles.  It is possible to
weight training examples or construct Bayesian models to account for uncertainty
or non-independence in the data. To this end, Park et al.
[@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002957] estimated shared non-biological signal
between datasets to correct for non-independence related to assay platform or
other factors in a Bayesian integration of many datasets. However, such
techniques are rarely placed front and center in any description of methods,
and so may be easily overlooked.

For some types of data, especially images, it is straightforward to augment
training datasets by splitting a single labeled example into multiple examples.
For example, an
image can easily be rotated, flipped, or translated and retain its label
[@doi:10.1101/095794].  3D MRI and 4D fMRI (with time as a dimension) data can
be decomposed into sets of 2D images [@doi:10.1101/070441]. This can greatly
expand the number of training examples
but artificially treats such derived images as independent
instances and sacrifices the structure inherent in the data.  CellCnn trains a
model to recognize rare cell populations in single-cell data by creating
training instances that consist of random subsets of cells that are randomly
sampled with replacement from the full dataset [@tag:Arvaniti2016_rare_subsets].

Simulated or semi-synthetic training data has also been employed in multiple
biomedical domains. `TODO:  simulated data: #5 #99 #293, maybe #117 and #197.
There is a counter-example from drug discovery to include as well
that is related to #55`

Multimodal, multi-task, and transfer learning, discussed in detail below, can
also combat data limitations to some degree. There are also emerging network
architectures, such as Diet Networks for high-dimensional SNP data
[@tag:Romero2017_diet]. These use multiple networks to drastically
reduce the number of free parameters by first flipping the problem and training
a network to predict parameters (weights) for each input (SNP) to learn a
feature embedding. This embedding (i.e. PCA, per class histograms, or a Word2vec
[@tag:Word2Vec] generalization) can be learned directly from input data or
take advantage of other datasets or domain knowledge. Additionally, in this
task the features are the examples, an important advantage when it is typical to
have 500 thousand or more SNPs and only a few thousand patients. Finally, this
embedding is of
a much lower dimension, allowing for a large reduction in the number of free
parameters. In the example given, the number of free
parameters from was reduced from 30 million to 50 thousand, a factor of 600.

### Hardware limitations and scaling

Efficiently scaling deep learning is challenging, and there is a high
computational cost (e.g. time, memory, energy) associated with training neural
networks and using them for classification. This is one of the reasons
why neural networks have
only recently found widespread use [@tag:Schmidhuber2014_dnn_overview].

Many have sought to curb these costs, with methods ranging from
the very applied (e.g. reduced numerical precision [@tag:Gupta2015_prec
@tag:Bengio2015_prec @tag:Sa2015_buckwild @tag:Hubara2016_qnn]) to the exotic
and theoretic (e.g. training small networks to mimic large networks and
ensembles [@tag:Caruana2014_need @tag:Hinton2015_dark_knowledge]). The largest
gains in efficiency have come from computation with graphics processing units
(GPUs) [@tag:Raina2009_gpu @tag:Vanhoucke2011_cpu @tag:Seide2014_parallel
@tag:Hadjas2015_cc @tag:Edwards2015_growing_pains
@tag:Schmidhuber2014_dnn_overview], which excel at the matrix and vector
operations so central to deep learning. The massively parallel nature of GPUs
allows additional optimizations, such as accelerated mini-batch gradient
descent [@tag:Vanhoucke2011_cpu @tag:Seide2014_parallel @tag:Su2015_gpu
@tag:Li2014_minibatch]. However, GPUs also have a limited quantity of memory,
making it difficult to implement networks of useful size and
complexity on a single GPU or machine [@tag:Raina2009_gpu
@tag:Krizhevsky2013_nips_cnn]. This restriction has sometimes forced
computational biologists to use workarounds or limit the size of an analysis.
For example, Chen et al. [@tag:Chen2016_gene_expr] aimed to infer the
expression level of all genes with a single neural network, but due to
memory restrictions they randomly partitioned genes into two halves and
analyzed each separately. In other cases, researchers limited the size
of their neural network [@tag:Wang2016_protein_contact
@tag:Gomezb2016_automatic]. Some have also chosen to use slower
CPU implementations rather than sacrifice network size or performance
[@tag:Yasushi2016_cgbvs_dnn].

While steady improvements in GPU hardware may alleviate this issue, it
is unclear whether advances can occur quickly enough to keep up with the growing
amount of available biological data or increasing network sizes. Much has
been done to minimize the memory
requirements of neural networks [@tag:CudNN @tag:Caruana2014_need
@tag:Gupta2015_prec @tag:Bengio2015_prec @tag:Sa2015_buckwild
@tag:Chen2015_hashing @tag:Hubara2016_qnn], but there is also growing
interest in specialized hardware, such as field-programmable gate arrays
(FPGAs) [@tag:Edwards2015_growing_pains @tag:Lacey2016_dl_fpga] and
application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). Specialized hardware promises
improvements in deep learning at reduced time, energy, and memory
[@tag:Edwards2015_growing_pains]. Obviously, there is as yet less software
available for such highly
specialized hardware [@tag:Lacey2016_dl_fpga], and it could be a difficult
investment for those not solely interested in deep learning. However, it is
likely that such options will find increased support as they become a more
popular platform for deep learning and general computation.

Distributed computing is a general solution to intense computational
requirements, and has enabled many large-scale deep learning efforts. Early
approaches to distributed computation [@tag:Mapreduce @tag:Graphlab] were
not suitable for deep learning [@tag:Dean2012_nips_downpour],
but much progress has been made. There
now exist a number of algorithms [@tag:Dean2012_nips_downpour @tag:Dogwild
@tag:Sa2015_buckwild], tools [@tag:Moritz2015_sparknet @tag:Meng2016_mllib
@tag:TensorFlow], and high-level libraries [@tag:Keras @tag:Elephas] for deep
learning in a distributed environment, and it is possible to train very complex
networks with limited infrastructure [@tag:Coates2013_cots_hpc]. Besides
handling very large networks, distributed or parallelized approaches offer
other advantages, such as improved ensembling [@tag:Sun2016_ensemble] or
accelerated hyperparameter optimization [@tag:Bergstra2011_hyper
@tag:Bergstra2012_random].

Cloud computing, which has already seen wide adoption in genomics
[@tag:Schatz2010_dna_cloud], could facilitate easier sharing of the large
datasets common to biology [@tag:Gerstein2016_scaling @tag:Stein2010_cloud],
and may be key to scaling deep learning. Cloud computing affords researchers
flexibility, and enables the use of specialized hardware (e.g.,
FPGAs, ASICs, GPUs) without major investment. As such, it
could be easier to address the different challenges associated with the
multitudinous layers and architectures available
[@tag:Krizhevsky2014_weird_trick]. Though many are reluctant to store sensitive
data (e.g. patient electronic health records) in the cloud,
secure/regulation-compliant cloud services do exist [@tag:RAD2010_view_cc].

### Data, code, and model sharing

A robust culture of data, code, and model sharing would do much to speed
advances in this domain. The cultural barriers of data sharing in particular are
perhaps best captured by the implications of using the term "research parasite"
to describe scientists who use data from other researchers
[@doi:10.1056/NEJMe1516564]. In short, a field that honors only discoveries and
not the hard work of generating useful data will have difficulty encouraging
scientists to share their hard-won data. Unfortunately, it's precisely those
data that would help to power deep learning in the domain. Efforts are underway
to recognize those who promote an ecosystem of rigorous sharing and analysis
[@doi:10.1038/ng.3830].

The sharing of high-quality, labeled datasets will be especially valuable.  In
addition, researchers who invest time to preprocess datasets to be suitable for
deep learning can make the preprocessing code (e.g. Basset
[@tag:Kelley2016_basset] and variationanalysis [@tag:Torracinta2016_deep_snp])
and cleaned data (e.g. MoleculeNet [@tag:Wu2017_molecule_net]) publicly
available to catalyze further research. However, there are complex privacy and
legal issues involved in sharing patient data that cannot be ignored.
Furthermore, in some domains, some of the best training data has been generated
privately, for example, high-throughput chemical screening data at
pharmaceutical companies. One perspective is that there is little expectation or
incentive for this private data to be shared. However, data are not inherently
valuable. Instead, the insights that we glean from them are where the value
lies. Private companies may establish a competitive advantage by releasing
sufficient data for improved methods to be developed.

Code sharing and open source licensing is essential for continued progress in
this domain.  We strongly advocate following established best practices for
sharing source code, archiving code in repositories that generate digital object
identifiers, and open licensing [@doi:10.1126/science.aah6168] regardless of
the minimal requirements, or lack thereof, set by journals, conferences, or
preprint servers.  In addition, it is important for authors to share not only
code for their core models but also scripts and code used for data cleaning (see
above) and hyperparameter optimization.  These improve reproducibility and serve
as documentation of the detailed decisions that impact model performance but may
not be exhaustively captured in a manuscript's methods text.

Because many deep learning models are often built using one of several popular
software frameworks, it is also possible to directly share trained
predictive models.  The availability of pre-trained models can accelerate
research, with image classifiers as an apt example.  A pre-trained neural
network can be quickly fine-tuned on new data and used in transfer learning,
as discussed below.  Taking this idea to the extreme, genomic data has been
artificially encoded as images in order to benefit from pre-trained image
classifiers [@tag:Poplin2016_deepvariant]. "Model zoos" -- collections of
pre-trained models -- are not yet common in biomedical domains but have
started to
appear in genomics applications [@tag:Angermueller2016_single_methyl
@tag:Dragonn].  Sharing models for patient data requires great care because deep
learning models can be attacked to identify examples used in training.  We
discuss this issue as well as recent techniques to mitigate these concerns in
the patient categorization section.

DeepChem [@tag:AltaeTran2016_one_shot @tag:DeepChem @tag:Wu2017_molecule_net]
and DragoNN [@tag:Dragonn] exemplify the benefits of sharing pre-trained models
and code under an open source license. DeepChem, which targets drug discovery
and quantum chemistry, has actively encouraged and received community
contributions of learning algorithms and benchmarking datasets.  As a
consequence, it now supports of a large suite of machine learning approaches,
both deep learning and competing strategies that can be run on diverse test
cases.  This realistic, continual evaluation will play a critical role in
assessing which techniques are most promising for chemical screening and drug
discovery.  Like formal, organized challenges such as the ENCODE-DREAM *in vivo*
Transcription Factor Binding Site Prediction Challenge [@tag:Dream_tf_binding],
`TODO: placeholder URL until the preprint is available` DeepChem provides a
forum for the fair, critical evaluations that are not always conducted in
individual methodological papers, which can be biased toward favoring a new
proposed algorithm.  Likewise DragoNN (Deep RegulAtory GenOmic Neural
Networks), offers
not only code and a model zoo but also a detailed tutorial and partner package
for simulating training data.  These resources, especially the ability to
simulate datasets that are sufficiently complex to demonstrate the challenges of
training neural networks but small enough to train quickly on a CPU, are
important for (human) training and attracting machine learning researchers to
problems in genomics and healthcare.  We have even included DragoNN and hands-on
model training into the curriculum of a graduate student course.

### Multimodal, multi-task, and transfer learning

As discussed above, the fact that biomedical datasets often contain a limited
number of instances or labels can be a cause of poor performance of
machine learning algorithms. When trained on such datasets, deep learning
models are particularly prone to overfitting due to their high representational
power. However, transfer learning techniques also known as domain adaptation
enable transfer of extracted patterns between different datasets and even
domains. This approach consists of training a model for the base task, and
subsequently reusing the trained model
for the target problem in hand. The first step allows a model to take advantage
of a larger amount of data and/or labels to extract better feature
representations. Transferring learnt features in deep neural networks
improves performance compared to randomly initialized features even
when pre-training and target sets are dissimilar. However,
transferability of features decreases as the distance between the base task
and target task increases [@tag:Yosinski2014].

In image analysis, previous examples of deep transfer learning applications
proved large scale natural image sets [@tag:Russakovsky2015_imagenet]
to be useful for pre-training models that can then serve as generic feature
extractors applied to various types of biological images
[@tag:Zhang2015_multitask_tl @tag:Zeng2015 @tag:Angermueller2016_dl_review
@tag:Pawlowski2016]. More recently, deep learning models trained to predict
protein sub-cellular localization successfully performed predictions for
proteins not originally present in the training set [@tag:Parnamaa2017].
Moreover, in this type of task, learnt features performed reasonably well even
when applied to images obtained using different fluorescent labels, imaging
techniques, and different cell types [@tag:Kraus2017_deeploc]. However, there
are no established theoretical guarantees for feature transferability between
distant domains such as natural images and various modalities of biological
imaging. Because learnt patterns are represented in deep neural networks in a
layer-wise hierarchical fashion, this issue is usually addressed by fixing an
empirically chosen number of layers that preserve generic characteristics
of both training and target datasets. The model is then fine-tuned by
re-training multiple networks' top layers on the specific dataset in order to
re-learn domain-specific high level concepts (e.g. fine-tuning for
radiology image classification [@tag:Rajkomar2017_radiographs]).
Fine-tuning on specific biological datasets enables more focused predictions.
The Basset package [@tag:Kelley2016_basset] for prediction of functional
activities from DNA sequences was shown to rapidly learn and accurately predict
on new data by leveraging a model pre-trained on available public data.
To simulate this scenario, authors put aside 15 of 164 cell type datasets
and trained the Basset model on the remaining 149 datasets. Then, they
fine-tuned the model with one training pass of each of the remaining datasets
and achieved results close to the model trained on all 164 datasets together.
In another example, Min et al.
[@tag:Min2016_deepenhancer] demonstrated how training on the experimentally
validated FANTOM5 permissive enhancer dataset followed by fine-tuning on ENCODE
enhancer datasets improved cell type-specific predictions, outperforming
state-of-the-art results.  In drug design, general RNN models trained to
generate molecules from the ChEMBL database have been fine-tuned to produce
drug-like compounds for specific targets [@tag:Segler2017_drug_design
@tag:Olivecrona2017_drug_design].

Related to transfer learning, multimodal learning assumes
simultaneous learning from various types of inputs, such as images and text.
It allows capture of features that describe common concepts across input
modalities. Generative graphical models like restricted Boltzmann
machines (RBM) and their stacked versions, deep Boltzmann machines (DBM), and
deep belief networks (DBN), demonstrate successful extraction of
more informative features for one modality
(images or video) when jointly learnt with other modalities
(audio or text) [@tag:Ngiam2011].
Deep graphical models such as DBNs are considered to be well suited for
multimodal learning tasks since they learn a joint probability
distribution from inputs. They can be pre-trained in an unsupervised fashion
on large unlabeled data and then fine-tuned on a smaller number of labeled
examples. When labels are available, convolutional neural networks (CNN) are
ubiquitously used since they can be trained end-to-end with backpropagation
and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in many discriminative tasks
[@tag:Angermueller2016_dl_review].

Jha et al. [@tag:Jha2017_integrative_models] showed that an integrated training
approach delivers better performance compared to individual networks. They
compared a number of feed-forward architectures trained on RNA-seq data
with and without an additional set of CLIP-seq, knockdown, and over-expression
based input features. Results showed that the integrative deep model
generalized well for combined data, offering large performance improvement
for alternative splicing event estimation.
Chaudhary et al. [@tag:Chaudhary2017_multiom_liver_cancer] trained a deep
autoencoder model jointly on RNA-seq, miRNA-seq, and methylation data from TCGA
to predict survival subgroups of hepatocellular carcinoma patients. This
multimodal approach that treated different omics as different modalities
outperformed both traditional methods (PCA) and single-omic models.
Interestingly, multi-omic model performance did not improve when combined
with clinical information, suggesting that the model was able to capture
redundant contributions of clinical features through their correlated
genomic features.
Chen et al. [@tag:Chen2015_trans_species] used deep belief networks to learn
phosphorylation states of a common set of signaling proteins in primary
cultured bronchial cells collected from rats and humans treated
with distinct stimuli. By interpreting species as different modalities
representing similar high-level concepts, they showed that DBNs were able
to capture cross-species representation of signaling mechanisms in response
to a common stimuli. Another application used DBNs for joint unsupervised
feature learning from cancer datasets containing gene expression,
DNA methylation, and miRNA expression data [@tag:Liang2015_exprs_cancer].
This approach allowed for the capture of intrinsic relationships in
different modalities and for better clustering performance over conventional
k-means based methods.

Multimodal learning with CNNs is usually implemented as a collection of
individual networks in which each learns representations from single data type.
These individual representations are further concatenated before or within
fully-connected layers. FIDDLE [@tag:Eser2016_fiddle] is an example of
multimodal CNNs that represents an ensemble of individual networks that take
as inputs a number of genomic datasets, including NET-seq, MNase-seq, ChIP-seq,
RNA-seq, and raw DNA sequence to predict Transcription Start Site-seq
(TSS-seq) outputs. The combined model radically improves performance over
separately trained datatype-specific networks, suggesting that it learns the
synergistic relationship between datasets.

Multi-task learning (MTL) is an approach related to transfer learning.
In an MTL framework a model co-learns a number of tasks simultaneously such that
features are shared across them.
DeepSEA framework [@tag:Zhou2015_deep_sea] implemented a multi-task joint
learning of diverse chromatin factors sharing predictive features from raw
DNA sequence. This allowed, for example, a sequence feature that is effective
in recognizing binding of a specific TF to be simultaneously used by
another predictor for a physically interacting TF.
Similarly, TFImpute [@tag:Qin2017_onehot], a CNN-RNN architecture learned
information shared across transcription factors and cell lines to predict
cell-specific TF binding for TF-cell line combinations based on only a
small fraction (4%) of the combinations using available ChIP-seq data. On
multiple test sets that excluded specific TFs and cell lines, TFImpute showed
comparable or superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art.
Yoon et al.[@tag:Yoon2016_cancer_reports], previously discussed in the section
on Electronic Health Records, demonstrated that predicting the primary cancer
site from the cancer pathology reports together with its laterality
substantially improved the performance for the latter task, suggesting that
MTL can effectively leverage the commonality between two tasks using
a shared representation.
A number of studies previously mentioned in the section on developing new
treatments employed multi-task learning approach to predict a large number
of compound and target interactions for drug discovery
[@tag:Dahl2014_multi_qsar @tag:Ramsundar2015_multitask_drug]
and drug toxicity prediction
[@tag:Mayr2016_deep_tox @tag:Hughes2016_macromol_react]. Kearnes et al.
[@tag:Kearnes2016_admet] did a systematic comparison of single-task and
multi-task deep models on a set of industrial ADMET datasets. They confirmed
that multi-task learning can improve performance over single-task models. They
further showed that smaller datasets tend to benefit more from multitask
learning than larger datasets. Results emphasized that multi-task effects are
highly dataset-dependent, suggesting the use of dataset-specific models to
maximize overall performance.

MTL approach is complementary to multimodal and transfer learning. All three
techniques can be used together in the same model. For example, Zhang et al.
[@tag:Zhang2015_multitask_tl] combined deep model-based transfer and multi-task
learning for cross-domain image annotation. One could imagine extending that
approach to multimodal inputs as well. Common characteristic of these methods
lies in better generalization of extracted features by leveraging relationships
between information in provided in inputs and task objectives, represented at
various hierarchical levels of abstraction in a deep learning model structure.

Despite demonstrated improvements, transfer learning approaches also pose
a number of challenges. As mentioned above, there are no theoretically sound
principles for pre-training and fine-tuning. Most best practice recommendations
are heuristic and have to take into account additional hyper-parameters that
depend on specific deep architectures, sizes of pre-training and target
datasets, and similarity of domains. However, similarity of datasets and domains
in transfer learning and relatedness of tasks in MTL are difficult to access.
Most current studies address these limitations by empirical evaluation of the
model using established best practices or heuristics and cross-validation.
Unfortunately, negative results are typically left out and not
presented in the final study publications.
Results by Rajkomar et al. [@tag:Rajkomar2017_radiographs] showed that a deep
CNN trained on natural images can boost radiology image classification
performance. However, due to differences in imaging domains, target task
required either re-training the initial model from scratch with special
pre-processing or fine-tuning of the whole network on radiographs with heavy
data augmentation to avoid overfitting. Exclusively fine-tuning top layers led
to much lower validation accuracy (81.4 vs 99.5).
Fine-tuning procedure for the discussed Basset model pre-trained on data
from different cell types required no more than one training pass. Otherwise,
the model started overfitting new data [@tag:Kelley2016_basset].
DeepChem successfully improved results for low-data drug discovery
with one-shot learning for related tasks. However, it demonstrated clear
limitations to cross-task generalization across unrelated tasks in one-shot
models, specifically nuclear receptor assays and patient adverse reactions
[@tag:AltaeTran2016_one_shot].

Overall, multimodal, multi-task and transfer learning strategies demonstrate
high potential for many biomedical applications that are otherwise limited
by data volume and presence of labels. However, these methods not only inherit
most methodological issues from natural image, text, and audio domains, but also
pose new challenges, specific to biological data. Making negative results,
source code, and pre-trained models publicly available helps to accelerate
progress in this direction. However, there are privacy considerations for models
trained on sensitive data, such as patient-related information (see Data
sharing section). Thus, there is a compelling need for the development of
privacy-preserving transfer learning algorithms, such as Private Aggregation
of Teacher Ensembles (PATE-G) [@tag:Papernot2017_pate], that can leverage
publicly available data. We suggest that these types of models deserve deeper
investigation to establish sound theoretical guarantees and best practices and
determine limits for the transferability of features between various closely
related and distant learning tasks.
