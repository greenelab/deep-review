## Conclusions

Final thoughts and future outlook here. The Discussion will give an overview
and the Conclusion will provide a short, punchy take home message.

Points to mention based on discussion thus far that may make the bar for
conclusions:

* Limitations of data & workarounds (availability impacts on amount, etc)
* Transferability of features
* Strong enthusiasm for unsupervised approaches.
* Right to an explanation (possibly, depends if raised in multiple areas)

### Author contributions

`TODO: not sure if it should go here, but somewhere we should talk about how we
wrote this thing, since it is still somewhat unconventional to have a review
written in this manner.` We recognized that writing a review on a rapidly
developing area in a manner that allowed us to provide a forward-looking
perspective on diverse approaches and biological problems would require
expertise from across computational biology and medicine. We created an open
repository on the GitHub version control system and engaged with numerous
authors from papers within and outside of the area. Paper review was conducted
in the open by `#` individuals, and the manuscript was drafted in a series of
commits from `#` authors. Individuals who met the ICJME standards of authorship
are included as authors. These were individuals who contributed to the review of
the literature; drafted the manuscript or provided substantial critical
revisions; approved the final manuscript draft; and agreed to be accountable in
all aspects of the work. Individuals who did not contribute in one or more of
these ways, but who did participate, are acknowledged at the end of the
manuscript.
